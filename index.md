Boston Python is a large and vibrant Python user group in the Boston area.  We run [two events](events.md) most months. Anyone interested in any aspect of the Python world is welcome!

We use [Slack](slack.md) for online discussions.

All of our interactions are covered by our [code of conduct](code-of-conduct.md).

If you are an employer, you can [announce jobs](jobs.md) and even [sponsor](sponsorship.md) or [host](hosting.md) events.
