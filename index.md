Boston Python is a large and vibrant Python user group in the Boston area.  We
run [a number of kinds of events](events.md). Anyone interested in any aspect of the
Python world is welcome!

We use [Slack](slack.md) for online discussions.

All of our interactions are covered by our [code of conduct](code-of-conduct.md).

If you are an employer, you can [announce jobs](jobs.md) and even
[sponsor](sponsorship.md) or [host](hosting.md) events.

We appreciate [our sponsors](our_sponsors.md)! Learn more about the organizations
that support us.
