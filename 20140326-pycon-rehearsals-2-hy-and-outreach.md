Join us for two PyCon presentation rehearsal, sponsored by Kyruus and AppNeta:

Getting Hy on Python: How to implement a Lisp front-end to Python — Paul Tagliamonte (45 min)

This talk will cover the internals of Python, such AST, Import hooks, creating a console, and a very brief overview of Python internal formats (such as pyc files), by way of looking over the implementation of a Lisp called "Hy". No Lisp knowledge is required.

Outreach Program for Women: Lessons in Collaboration — Marina Zhurakhinskaya (30 min)

Since 2010, the GNOME Foundation’s Outreach Program for Women has provided 130 women with an opportunity to participate in remote internships with 23 Free Software organizations. This talk will cover the history of the program, what makes it successful, how the same strategies can be used for engaging all new contributors, and what other initiatives help increase diversity in Free Software.
