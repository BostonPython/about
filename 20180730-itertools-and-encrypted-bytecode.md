Pizza sponsored by DataRobot (https://www.datarobot.com).

Two talks tonight!

Eugene Kovalev, Itertools

Itertools is one of the treasure boxes of the Python standard library. It has tools for working with iteration of all kinds. We'll look at some of them, and at some interesting uses of them.

Wolfgang Richter, Encrypted Bytecode

This talk will explain how we modified the `import` statement of the Python language to import encrypted Python bytecode. We will explain the behind-the-scenes import machinery of Python, how we hooked into it, and how we typically distribute keys. You'll be able to experiment with our technique during the talk, and at home by using our recently open sourced library.
