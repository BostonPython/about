We are always interested in ideas for new events. It could be a presentation night on a particular topic, or a new kind of event altogether.  Many of our current events were first proposed by members.

To start planning an event:

1. Join us in the **#organizing** channel in [our Slack workspace](slack.md).  Start a conversation along the lines of "I'm thinking about XYZ," and get a discussion going about what shape the event could take.

1. Find a [leader](contact.md) to pair with in the planning process. They can help think of all the things to consider, find other people to brainstorm with, and then get the event officially listed on meetup.com.  Jon, Emily, James, or Ned are good possibilities.

1. Stay active in the discussions that happen in Slack.  We plan collaboratively.  Others will have helpful ideas or tips to make the event successful.
