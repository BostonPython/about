Welcome to another installment of our Fundamental Topics series, thanks to InsightSquared and Solano Labs for sponsoring!

All of the talks at this event are perfect for motivated beginners and intermediate programmers looking to level up their Python and programming skills through a mix of theoretical and practical topics.

The talks will be live-streamed and recorded and available at http://youtube.com/bostonpython. Thanks to CustomMade for making it happen!

Tonight we'll cover:

1. Names and values (Ned Batchelder)

Ned will make us all experts with the ins and outs of assignment. Learn about mutable and immutable data types, and why this bit of code behaves the way it does:
nums = [1, 2, 3]
tri = nums
nums.append(4)
print(tri)
2. Basic data structures and analyzing algorithmic complexity (Jessica McKellar)
When should you use a dictionary versus a list, tuple, or set? Have you ever written code that seems like it should run quickly but takes forever? We'll break down what data structures are efficient for various use cases and practice analyzing the runtime complexity of our algorithms.
3. Virtualenv and pip (Giles Hall)
virtualenv creates isolated Python environments, so you can work on multiple projects simultaneously without causing problems in one project by upgrading or uninstalling Python packages for another.
pip is a tool for installing Python libraries.
Giles will help us master both of these tools and develop a clean routine for starting new projects.
4. How to find answers to your questions (Deb Nicholson)
90% of programming is knowing how to confidently and efficiently find answers to your questions!
