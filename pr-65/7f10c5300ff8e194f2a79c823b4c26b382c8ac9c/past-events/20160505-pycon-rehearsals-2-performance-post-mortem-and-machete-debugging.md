Two PyCon-bound speakers will rehearse their talks, sponsored by Better Outcomes (http://www.betteroutcomes.com).

Geoff Gerrietts: Diving into the Wreck: a Postmortem Look at Real-World Performance (https://us.pycon.org/2016/schedule/presentation/2032/)

As a young engineer interested in performance, much of the advice I saw on performance management focused on algorithms and rules of thumb. It’s good advice, but it doesn’t address the most common problems. This talk will cover a handful of the most common performance problems I’ve encountered in my career. We will talk about how to recognize them, what causes them, and how to resolve them. More info... (https://us.pycon.org/2016/schedule/presentation/2032/)

Ned Batchelder: Machete-mode Debugging: Hacking Your Way Out of a Tight Spot (https://us.pycon.org/2016/schedule/presentation/1658/)

When chasing mysterious bugs, it's helpful to use all the tools at your disposal. We'll explore ways to use Python's dynamic tools to help track down the cause of head-scratching problems in large systems. Tools include the inspect module, monkey-patching, trace functions, and the Python mechanisms at work behind them all. More info... (https://us.pycon.org/2016/schedule/presentation/1658/)

Pizza will be provided.

Because these are rehearsals, we will not be recording. You'll be able to see the recording from the actual presentation given at PyCon.
