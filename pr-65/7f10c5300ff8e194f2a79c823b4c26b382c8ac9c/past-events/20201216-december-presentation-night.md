<p>Three presentations tonight:<br/><br/>------------------------------<br/><br/>Peter Mangione: Building a Virtual Rain Gauge<br/><br/>Abstract: How much rainfall has my yard received this week? This seems like a simple question, but often it is not. You might need this information because you are a gardener or want to know if you have to turn the sprinkler on tomorrow. Maybe you are just a curious weather nerd (like me).<br/><br/>Unless you have your own rain gauge, figuring out rainfall can take some work. Airports like Boston Logan and TF Green in Providence consistently record daily rainfall, but you might not live very close to the airport. That's why I wrote a short Python script which collects rainfall data from nearby rain gauges. You provide the address and the dates of interest, and the script does the rest of the work!<br/><br/>Python concepts that will be covered are lists, loops, and dictionaries. This will be a beginner level presentation, although some base knowledge of lists and dictionaries is helpful.<br/><br/>------------------------------<br/><br/>Ruth Caswell Smith: Intro to Pandas Dataframes using the Advent of Code<br/><br/>See how intuitive Pandas dataframes are to use. In this lightning talk we'll explore implementing the solution to a day from the Advent of Code using Pandas dataframes and their methods.<br/><br/>------------------------------<br/><br/>Heather Kusmierz: On Python and Positioning: An Introduction to Working with Geospatial Data in Python with GeoPandas<br/><br/>This presentation will introduce the basics of working with geospatial data including data models, common file formats, and just enough underlying theory to be dang.. er...know what to look out for. Then we'll run through a few code examples demonstrating some of the geospatial functionality using the Python package GeoPandas.</p>
