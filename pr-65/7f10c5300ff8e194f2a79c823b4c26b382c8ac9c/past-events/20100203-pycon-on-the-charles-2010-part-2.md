In preparation for PyCon in Atlanta (http://us.pycon.org/2010/about/) in February, three more Boston-area PyCon speakers will rehearse their talks for us. It's a full night, so we'll start promptly at 7:00. For some open-ended mingling, show up as early as 6:15!

Demystifying Non-Blocking and Asynchronous I/O
Peter Portante

We will first define what blocking, non-blocking, synchronous and asynchronous I/O are under the POSIX interfaces. We'll cover how and when these four types of I/O should be used, and their individual effects on a Python based application. The notion of concurrency will be discussed by comparing a simple threaded blocking I/O application to a simple single threaded non-blocking I/O application by walking the attendees through the python code for those applications.

Turtles All The Way Down: Demystifying Deferreds, Decorators, and Declarations
Glyph Lefkowitz

Python's flexible object model allows library and framework authors to add very flexible declarations. Metaclasses, decorators, callable objects, and operator overloading practically allow libraries to re-define the language in order to provide a more concise, natural style for that library. Unfortunately, the library user's first experience of such conveniences is often confusing, because it's not clear what's going on.

In this talk, I will try to convince you that all of this wonderful magic isn't all that weird. This is not a typical how-to session on how to use a particular feature, either of Python or of Twisted, but will rather draw examples from Python, Twisted, and Zope to illustrate techniques you can use to read and understand "magical" Python code.

Keynote: Relentlessly Pursuing Opportunities With Python, or why the AIs will Spare Us All!
Antonio Rodriguez

DJ-ing in Python: Audio processing fundamentals
Edward Abrams

I have been wanting to learn about audio processing because I'd eventually like to write a simple DJ-ing application. What better way to explore some intermediate level programming concepts, as well as an interesting media library (PyMedia), than by doing it in Python. This talk covers what I learned on my way to creating a console-based skeleton of a DJ-ing application with the intention of later returning to add a GUI on top.
