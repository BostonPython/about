Ned Batchelder, What I Did on my Summer Vacation

This summer I started a new side project. I encountered some of the same issues as in any project. This talk is a rambling exploration of some of them. I'll explain Python facilities as I go, and get into thornier engineering questions: what is big-O notation, and how does it affect code speed? What's up with Python's special methods? How to choose data representations? How to deal with other people's code? How to manage uncertainty? And most importantly: how to overcome your own fears and doubts.

This talk covers a lot of ground, but should be good for beginners and up.
