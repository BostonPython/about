Join us for two talks plus a lightning talk, sponsored by AppNeta (http://appneta.com).

Liza Daly: NaNoGenMo 2014: A procedurally generated mysterious codex

The idea of NaNoGenMo is to spend a month writing code to generate a "novel", a twist on NaNoWriMo. Liza will tell us about her entries, including a Voynich-inspired mystery codex (https://blog.safaribooksonline.com/2014/11/08/nanogenmo2014-procedurally-generated-mysterious-codex/). The code involves finding images, producing PDFs, randomizing layouts, and other techniques that could even find a place in "useful" programs.

en zyme: Duck hunting: Type hints for Python

Guido is stirring the pot again! PEP 484 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) proposes adding a type hinting mechanism to Python. As you might imagine, this is controversial. Is our dynamic BDFL supporting a powerful new feature, or just being coerced by anti-pythonic staticism?

Matt Bachmann: Opening the Floodgate: Unicode Identifiers with Python

Python 3 allows using Unicode characters in identifiers. That can create some unusual possibilities and problems. What if we take it even further...?

Pizza will be provided!
