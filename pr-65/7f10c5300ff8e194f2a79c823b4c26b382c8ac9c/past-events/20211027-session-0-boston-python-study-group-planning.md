<p><br/><br/></p>

<p>This is a preparatory meeting to sketch out what the upcoming study group semester looks like. We are going to pursue data science as the high-level topic, but it's possible that we run two or more groups in parallel if there's enough interest and participation.<br/><br/>You should attend this if:<br/>- you are interested in being a core member of the study group<br/>- you want to have a voice in what topics are on the syllabus<br/>- you want to know if this study group is right for you<br/>- you are interested in branching off and running a parallel study group<br/><br/>Hopefully we'll come out of this with a core group identified, a list of topics for each of the sessions, and a schedule for the "semester".<br/><br/>More info available on the Boston Python slack workspace: <a class="link" href="https://about.bostonpython.com/slack" rel="nofollow ugc" target="_blank" title="https://about.bostonpython.com/slack">https://about.bostonpython.com/slack</a></p>
