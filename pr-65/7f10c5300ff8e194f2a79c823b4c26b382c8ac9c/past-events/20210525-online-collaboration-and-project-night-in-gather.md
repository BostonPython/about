We'll have tables for specific topics: Starting Out, Data Science, Machine Learning, Testing, Web, Hardware, and so on. Let us know what topic you want!<br/><br/>We have a Google Doc for you to see the topics and say a little about what you'd like to do: <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_bBbP5tWXI9RJHwWxvZ2WNGcQOsZ8hMygJziaeBJzkM" rel="nofollow ugc" target="_blank" title="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_bBbP5tWXI9RJHwWxvZ2WNGcQOsZ8hMygJziaeBJzkM">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_bBbP5tWXI9RJHwWxvZ2WNGcQOsZ8hMygJziaeBJzkM</a><br/><br/>There are no pre-determined projects, no presentations. You do not have to show anything if you don't want to. This is an open-ended opportunity to work together with like-minded people.<br/><br/>Hosts will be on hand help you find the right room and collaborators.<br/><br/>Bring ideas. Bring questions. Bring enthusiasm. Bring friends. The Boston Python Project &amp; Collaboration Night is a time to find others with compatible interests. Code, hack, teach, learn, meet, laugh, talk: anything goes at Project Night.<br/><br/>All skill levels are welcome. There will be at least two rooms of beginning learners, and helpers for them. Other topics in the past have been Django, Data, Web Scraping, Hardware, Puzzles, Science, Testing, Art. Maybe you have another idea? Bring it! <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_bBbP5tWXI9RJHwWxvZ2WNGcQOsZ8hMygJziaeBJzkM" rel="nofollow ugc" target="_blank" title="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_bBbP5tWXI9RJHwWxvZ2WNGcQOsZ8hMygJziaeBJzkM">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_bBbP5tWXI9RJHwWxvZ2WNGcQOsZ8hMygJziaeBJzkM</a><br/><br/>Here are some Python resources to get you started: <a class="link" href="https://about.bostonpython.com/resources" rel="nofollow ugc" target="_blank" title="https://about.bostonpython.com/resources">https://about.bostonpython.com/resources</a><br/><br/>Feel free to discuss ideas beforehand on our Slack: <a class="link" href="https://about.bostonpython.com/slack" rel="nofollow ugc" target="_blank" title="https://about.bostonpython.com/slack">https://about.bostonpython.com/slack</a><br/><br/>We'll all be online starting at 6:30!</p>
