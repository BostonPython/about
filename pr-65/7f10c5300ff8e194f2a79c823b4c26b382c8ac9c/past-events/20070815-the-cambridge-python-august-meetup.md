Fellow Snake Charmers,

Data access is usually where the rubber meets the road. This Meetup will focus who we get data in and out of Python applications.

Be prepared to discuss you best and worst experiences -- querying minds want to know.

In keeping with our discussion, the feature presentation is on STORM.

What is Storm?

Storm is an object-relational mapper (ORM) for Python developed at Canonical. The project has been in development for more than a year for use in Canonical projects such as Launchpad, and has recently been released as an open-source product.

Christopher Armstrong of Canonical will walk us through this open source project. Sometimes called the International Man of Twistery, Christopher is also involved in the Twisted project. This should be a great presentation.

Drop me a line if you have any questions.

Best Regards!

Peter
