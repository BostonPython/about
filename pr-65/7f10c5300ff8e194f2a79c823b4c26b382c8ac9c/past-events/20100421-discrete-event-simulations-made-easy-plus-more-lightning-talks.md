Francesco Pierfederici's Pycon talk touched briefly on simulations in Python, whetting our appetite for more detailed information. Francesco will talk more in-depth about discrete event simulations with SimPy:

Abstract
I will introduce SimPy (http://simpy.sourcefo... (http://simpy.sourceforge.net)), a Python framework for discrete-event simulations. I will describe the framework itself and its main components. I will then walk you through a simple but non-trivial simulation to explain how SimPy is used in practice. You can also read the wikipedia page on discrete event simulations (http://en.wikipedia.o... (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_event_simulation)) for some background info.

Last month's lightning talks were a big hit. We'll probably have time for one or two more: send me your ideas!

Free-form chilling starts at 6:30, formal activities at 7:00. Pizza will be provided by Microsoft!
