January 10, 2017


   

An evening of collegial cooperation, sponsored by Man Numeric Investors (http://numeric.com), (job listing (https://mancareers.resourcesolutions.com/gold/iapply/index.cfm?event=jobs.detail&jobid=899016)).

Bring a laptop. Bring ideas. Bring questions. Bring enthusiasm. Bring friends. The Boston Python Project Night is a time to find others with compatible interests, and work away. Code, hack, teach, learn, meet, laugh, talk: it all happens at Project Night.

All skill levels are welcome. There will be at least two tables of beginning learners, and helpers for them. Other table-topics in the past have been Django, Data, Web Scraping, Hardware, Puzzle, Science, Art. Anything goes!

Pizza will be provided! You can't be friendly, helpful, and productive if you're hungry...
