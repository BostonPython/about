Two foundational talks, sponsored by Twilio.

Brian Rutledge, Virtualenv

Virtualenv is a must-use tool for creating isolated Python environments. Find out what they are, why they are good, and how to use them.

Benjamin Zagorsky, Items vs Attributes

We'll dig in to the underpinnings of dot references vs square bracket references (thing.attr vs thing["item"]). What are they, and what are the philosophical differences? How do you use each? How do special methods __getattr__ and __getitem__ work? This will give you all the background you need.
