Hosted by PTC (https://ptc.com/), pizza sponsored by Formlabs (https://formlabs.com/)

Two speakers, in PTC's amazing showcase of CAD and 3D printing technologies.

Kostya Nazarenko: Teaching old CAD new tricks with Python

The experience of integrating Python interpreter into Creo, a thirty-years-old CAD application: why, what, how.

Bathsheba Grossman: A Rhino, a Python and a Grasshopper Walk Into a Bar (3D Design with Python in Rhinoceros)

This talk is about what happened when a sculptor decided to stop modeling and start generating. Rhinoceros® is a 3D CAD program with lots of scripting options, including Python and a node programming language called Grasshopper. Bathsheba will talk about some ways to build and manipulate 3D objects with these, and show some art she's been working on. See Bathsheba's work at http://bathsheba.com
