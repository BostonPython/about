Sponsored by the Plone Conference (https://2016.ploneconf.org): The international gathering for Plone and the Python Web world - training, talks, sprints, and party included. Be there!

Presentations tonight:

Aleksandr Koshkin, Hacking CPython internals

The internals of the Python interpreter can be fascinating, and if you are brave enough, can be used to make Python do things it "can't do." We'll see a bit of the internals, and a few "bad ideas." :)

Lightning talks by Tony Nelson (sending emails), Alex Orlovsky (descriptor wizardry), and maybe more.

Pizza will be provided.

Dun and Bradstreet is sponsoring drinks at Meadhall after the presentation.
