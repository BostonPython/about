We need a pizza sponsor; could it be you? Here's how to sponsor (http://bit.ly/BostonPythonSponsors).

Demba Ba, "Labs in the Wild": Teaching Signal Processing Using Wearables and Jupyter Notebooks in the Cloud

Jupyter notebooks and the Python ecosystem provide a unique opportunity for interactive, web-based, teaching of content that has not traditionally leveraged scientific computing resources. We discuss the design and implementation of a new biological signal processing course at Harvard, ES155, which fuses Wearable technology and cloud-based analysis of data. We describe our system in this talk, and perform a live demo of how students in our class interact with the system, and give examples of ingenious final projects put together by students.

David Baumgold, Looping Like a Pro in Python

The humble loop: it's hard to write a program without it. Whether it's processing numbers in a sequence, lines in a text file, users in a database, or any other list of things, you use loops all the time. But did you know that Python has a lot of different ways to write loops? Reaching for the right looping tool can make your code cleaner, more readable, easier to test, and it can even make it run faster! By the end of this talk, you'll be looping like a pro, and your code will be better for it.

Pizza will be provided.
