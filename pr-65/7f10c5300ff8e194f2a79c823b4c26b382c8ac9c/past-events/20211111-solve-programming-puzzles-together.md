<p><br/><br/></p>

<p>December is coming, which means it's time to gear up for another month of programming puzzles from adventofcode.com! Get together with your friends from the Boston Python community to collaborate on solutions to problems chosen from the last six years of this annual coding challenge.<br/><br/>Programming puzzles are a great way to stretch your programming skills, to learn about the resources of a programming language, and to keep your programming chops limber. Some people enjoy the competitive aspects - getting on a leaderboard, earning bragging rights - and some people just enjoy the satisfaction of the "aha!" moment when a solution comes into focus. Whichever sort you are, you're welcome to join us for an evening of collaboration and conversation.<br/><br/>This event is open to python users of all levels. Attendees should register with adventofcode.com prior to the event, and ideally try to solve some of the problems.<br/><br/>Please note: This will not be a competitive coding event. We probably won't write complete solutions for any of the problems we talk about! Instead, we'll be talking about how we develop solutions for non-obvious problems, and about implementation challenges that might apply to these solutions (such as processing input, useful libraries, and engineering tips).</p>
