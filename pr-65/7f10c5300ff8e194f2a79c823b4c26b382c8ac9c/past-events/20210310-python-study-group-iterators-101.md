<p>Boston Python is trying out a new type of meetup! This beginner-to-intermediate level study group is structured around the idea that teaching something is sometimes the best way to learn it.<br/><br/>Every session, we'll hear a presentation from a member of the group on a topic they've chosen to learn about. This is a low-key, casual presentation in whatever format makes sense for the topic. Afterwards we'll hold a mini Q&amp;A/discussion period so everyone can get involved. We'll rotate presenters and topics to keep things fresh. If you've been looking for the motivation to dive into that one mysterious Python feature that you've seen in the codebase, this might be the group for you!<br/><br/>For our very first session, we'll take a look at iterables and iterators, with a focus on the helpful built-in functions that Python provides to work with them. We'll also take a tiny peek at how they work under the hood. No prior knowledge is necessary - we'll build up any supporting concepts during the session.<br/><br/>Hope to see you there!<br/><br/>(Is there a topic you'd like to learn about?
