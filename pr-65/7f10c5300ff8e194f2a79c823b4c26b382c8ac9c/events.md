Boston Python runs a number of different events:

- **Presentation nights** feature presentations by members. These are technical
    peer-to-peer presentations. [Anyone can do one!](giving-a-presentation.md) Sometimes we do
    [lightning talks](lightning.md).
- **Collaboration nights** are unstructured times to sit with people with similar interests, and do whatever you would like to do.
- **Study Group** features presentations by members who are beginner-to-intermediate. Each presenter chooses a topic that they're unfamiliar with, researches it, and then teaches the group what they've learned.
- **Office hour** is a weekly hour to drop in and ask anything on your mind: [Office hour](officehour.md).
- **Book discussions** choose a Python book and work through it chapter by chapter as a group.
- **Python en Espa√±ol** are Spanish-language presentations.
- **Social events** happen sporadically to bring people together casually.

Most events are listed on the [Boston Python meetup page](http://bostonpython.com).  RSVP there to be sure to get a spot.

We're always interested in ideas for **new events**!  Read about how to start one at [Planning an event](planning.md).

We have a [long list of past events](past-events/index.md).
