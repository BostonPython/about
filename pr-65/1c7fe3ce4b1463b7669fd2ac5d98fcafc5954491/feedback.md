We want Boston Python events to be great for everyone.  We want them to be great for you.

Please let us know how the event was for you. Did you feel welcome? Did you find people to work with or talk with?  What could we do differently?

We really want to hear from you. Be **blunt** if you need to! Honest feedback will help us improve Boston Python for everyone.

Send us an email: [leaders@bostonpython.com](mailto:leaders@bostonpython.com?subject=Feedback), or to any one of us on the [Contact Us](contact.md) page.

Thanks, we really appreciate it!
