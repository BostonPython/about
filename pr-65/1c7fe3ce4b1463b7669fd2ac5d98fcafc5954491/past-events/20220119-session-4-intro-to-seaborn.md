<p><br/><br/></p>

<p>At this session, we'll have Jack D. back to tell us about Seaborn! Thanks to everyone for your patience as we rescheduled this event. A typical study group night has a 30-60 minute presentation, a question and answer session, and then some time for unstructured small-group discussion. Hope to see you there!<br/><br/>As this session will have limited space, please keep your RSVP status up to date. If you find that you won't be able to attend after all, please update your status on Meetup to "Not attending" so that someone on the waitlist will have a chance to join. Thanks!<br/><br/>More info available on the Boston Python slack workspace: <a class="link" href="https://about.bostonpython.com/slack" rel="nofollow ugc" target="_blank" title="https://about.bostonpython.com/slack">https://about.bostonpython.com/slack</a></p>
