Jiahao Chen will introduce us to two powerful packages for numeric and scientific work, NumPy and SciPy:

Python is rapidly gaining traction as a programming language for scientific computation. This evening, we examine how to use NumPy (http://numpy.scipy.org/) and SciPy (http://www.scipy.org/), two of the most widely used Python modules for numerical calculations, and explore their joint capabilities. We will also examine several use cases showing how numpy and scipy can greatly simplify the handling of data in arrays as well as facilitate code reuse by generating wrappers to external Fortran or C code.

If you work with numeric data, or do anything even remotely scientific, these packages are for you. Come learn how they can ease your complex computational problems!

If we have time, we'll throw in some lightning talks, especially if you have one related to numeric computing.

Pizza will be provided, of course.

Afterward, we'll head over to Meadhall for the usual after-presentation beers, socializing, and unwinding.
