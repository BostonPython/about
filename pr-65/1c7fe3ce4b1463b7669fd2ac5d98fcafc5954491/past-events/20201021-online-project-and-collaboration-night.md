<p>Online project night using Zoom. The event will open at 6:00, and we'll kick off officially at 6:30. Everyone is invited!<br/><br/>We'll have separate break-out rooms in Zoom for specific topics: Starting Out, Data Science, Machine Learning, Web, Hardware, and so on. Let us know what topic you want!<br/><br/>There are no pre-determined projects, no presentations. You do not have to show anything if you don't want to. This is an open-ended opportunity to work together with like-minded people.<br/><br/>Hosts will be on hand help you find the right room and collaborators.<br/><br/>If you want to help make the event run smoothly, send me an email (ned@bostonpython.com), or find us in the #organizing channel in Slack (<a class="link" href="https://about.bostonpython.com/slack" rel="nofollow ugc" target="_blank" title="https://about.bostonpython.com/slack">https://about.bostonpython.com/slack</a>).<br/><br/>Bring ideas.
