Three PyCon-bound speakers will rehearse their talks, sponsored by American Well (http://americanwell.com).

Dan Riti: Remote Calls != Local Calls: Graceful Degradation when Services Fail (https://us.pycon.org/2016/schedule/presentation/2027/)

In a world where we are becoming more dependent on the network to be reliable due to trends to decouple systems into distributed services, we must do our best to expect failure to occur everywhere and anywhere. This talks aims to explore different techniques for gracefully degrading when the networks fail and the services we depend on are no longer available. More info...

Matt Bachmann: Better Testing With Less Code: Property Based Testing With Python (https://us.pycon.org/2016/schedule/presentation/1927/)

Standard unit tests have developers test specific inputs and outputs. This works, but often what breaks code are the cases we did not think about. Property based testing has developers define properties of output and has the computer explore the possible inputs to verify these properties. This talk will introduce property based testing and provide real world examples and patterns. More info... (https://us.pycon.org/2016/schedule/presentation/1927/)

Pizza will be provided.

Because these are rehearsals, we will not be recording. You'll be able to see the recording from the actual presentation given at PyCon.
