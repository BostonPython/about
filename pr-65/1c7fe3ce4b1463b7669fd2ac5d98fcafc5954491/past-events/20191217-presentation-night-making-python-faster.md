<p><br/><br/></p>

<p>Tonight, two talks about extending Python with other languages, for speed. Pizza sponsored by Quantopian (<a class="link" href="https://www.quantopian.com/" rel="nofollow ugc" target="_blank" title="https://www.quantopian.com/">https://www.quantopian.com/</a>).<br/><br/>Daniel Williams, Python Optimization Options<br/><br/>A higher level survey of optimization options available for Python. This talk will particularly focuses on C-Family interfaces to Python. Each option is compared by complexity, speed up, and general ease of implementation.<br/><br/>Austin Hacker, Extending Python with Rust<br/><br/>This talk will demonstrate how to build Python extensions using the PyO3 rust library. PyO3 makes building Python extensions easy, allowing developers to combine everything great about Python with the speed and efficiency of Rust. Rust code will be shown during this talk but no Rust experience is required. By the end of the talk, you too will be able to write your own Python extensions in Rust!</p>
