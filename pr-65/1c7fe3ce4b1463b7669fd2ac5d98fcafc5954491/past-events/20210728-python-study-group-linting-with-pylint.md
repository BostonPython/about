<p>This week we'll talk about linting (enforcing code style rules) with a specific focus on the pylint package. This is a beginner-friendly presentation, so even if you don't know what linting is, you are welcome to come! We'll take it from the ground up. Hope to see you there!<br/><br/>*** NOTE *** As of now, I am still looking for people to fill the presenter slots. The choice of topic is pretty wide open: pick a Python feature/library/concept/environment that makes your life easier, and come tell us about it. If this sounds interesting, please contact me via Meetup and let me know!<br/>***<br/><br/>In a normal week, this is a beginner-to-intermediate level group that encourages learning by way of teaching. Each presenter chooses a topic that they're unfamiliar with, researches it, and then teaches the group what they've learned. We rotate presenters and topics to keep things fresh, so if you've been looking for the motivation to dive into that one mysterious Python feature that you've seen in the codebase, this might be the group for you!<br/><br/>Hope to see you there!<br/><br/>(Is there a topic you'd like to learn about (and then teach us)?
