<p><br/><br/></p>

<p>This week we'll talk about two common data formats, YAML and JSON, and how to work with them in Python. Mike C. will take us through what he's been learning about these, then we'll have a discussion section afterwards. If you're starting to work with data in Python, come join us!<br/><br/>This is a beginner-to-intermediate level group that encourages learning by way of teaching. Each presenter chooses a topic that they're unfamiliar with, researches it, and then teaches the group what they've learned. We rotate presenters and topics to keep things fresh, so if you've been looking for the motivation to dive into that one mysterious Python feature that you've seen in the codebase, this might be the group for you!<br/><br/>Hope to see you there!<br/><br/>(Is there a topic you'd like to learn about (and then teach us)?
