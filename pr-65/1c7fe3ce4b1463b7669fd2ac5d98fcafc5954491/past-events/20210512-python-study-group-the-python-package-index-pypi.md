<p>This week we're going to hear about the Python Package Index from Anush K. PyPI is an integral part of the Python ecosystem, so if it's still mysterious to you, come join us! No experience is required - we'll build up the topic from the ground up.<br/><br/>This is a beginner-to-intermediate level group that encourages learning by way of teaching. Each presenter chooses a topic that they're unfamiliar with, researches it, and then teaches the group what they've learned. We rotate presenters and topics to keep things fresh, so if you've been looking for the motivation to dive into that one mysterious Python feature that you've seen in the codebase, this might be the group for you!<br/><br/>Hope to see you there!<br/><br/>(Is there a topic you'd like to learn about (and then teach us)?
