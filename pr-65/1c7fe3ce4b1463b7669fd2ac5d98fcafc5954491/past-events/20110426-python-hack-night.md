We're starting a new event of the Boston Python Meetup: Python Hack Night, a chance to get together with Pythonistas of all abilities, to hack, chat, learn, teach, socialize, whatever suits you. There's no structure other than a location, some food (if we're lucky) and a bunch of Python people getting together.

I'm hoping this can be a regularly occurring event.

The first Hack Night will be Tuesday April 26th, at Performable, 486 Green St, Cambridge, 6:30-9:30pm (or so). Performable is buying the pizza, you're bringing the energy and ideas.
