Join us for a night of 100% lightning talks. A dozen or so topics, 5-10 minutes each, it will be fascinating! Currently, we have talks signed up ranging from image processing to energy to map/reduce to backward compatibility to dystopia and beyond!

No promises, but we might have room for one or two more. Let me know if you are interested.

Pizza will be sponsored by BitSight (http://bitsighttech.com).

This would be an interesting night for the Python-curious to attend, tell your friends: http://meetu.ps/ld8Qz
