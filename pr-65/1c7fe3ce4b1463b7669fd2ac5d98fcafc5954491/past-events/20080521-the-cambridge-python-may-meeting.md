Needs a location

   

Fellow Snake Charmers,

Google App Engine is making news for Python these days. The Google Doc API also supports Python. (It is even being used by some of our members.) Google's commitment to Python makes it applications implementation and API's worth taking a look at.

At this session we will watch the Google App Engine demo together. We will stop the MPG to discuss and ask questions. (If anyone has any experience with App Engine we won't hold it against them.)

Pizza and soda will be served. Donations are appreciated as usual to pay for Meetup and the food.

Note: As it gets hotter we may take a summer recess, being that there is not AC in the gallery. So unless we get a great speaker for next month, or another location we may have our next meeting in September.

Thoughts?

Thanks!
