For June, we've got an in-depth evening about Google App Engine. And due to some scheduling issues, we're on a different night (a Tuesday), and in a different location (Google's Cambridge offices).

Omer Trajman has built an RSS reader on App Engine: http://webwriting.com... (http://webwriting.com/reader/) He'll walk us through the basics of App Engine, and then dive into the details of how he built this particular application.

Google's Cambridge office is at 5 Cambridge Center. Parking is right behind the building (http://bit.ly/aLrkhH)... (http://bit.ly/aLrkhH)), and I believe will be free for the event. Our host Tay Karim is still working on the possibility of food also... :)

The talk starts at 7:00, general mingling starts at 6:30.
