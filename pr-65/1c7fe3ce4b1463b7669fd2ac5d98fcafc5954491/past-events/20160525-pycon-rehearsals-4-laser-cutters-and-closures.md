Two PyCon-bound speakers will rehearse their talks.

Giles Hall: Laser Cutters, 3D Printers, and Python (https://us.pycon.org/2016/schedule/presentation/2171/)

How to leverage python to generate physical, tangible things. We will discuss the basics of laser cutters, 3D printers, and how you can use python to design physical objects. After a brief introduction to these technologies, we will explore a few different examples of how we can use python to generate designs suitable for 3D printing and laser cutting. More info...

Thomas Ballinger: Finding closure with closures (https://us.pycon.org/2016/schedule/presentation/2231/)

What are closures all about anyway, and why is there a new keyword in Python 3? We'll look at what a closure is, their history in the Python language, what the Python 3 nonlocal keyword is about, and examine how closures are idiomatically used (and avoided) in Python.

Pizza will be provided.

Because these are rehearsals, we will not be recording. You'll be able to see the recording from the actual presentation given at PyCon.
