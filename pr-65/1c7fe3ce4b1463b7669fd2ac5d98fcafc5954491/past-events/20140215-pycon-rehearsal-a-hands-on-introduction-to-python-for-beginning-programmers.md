Beginning programmers: jumpstart your Python and programming careers with this 3-hour interactive tutorial.

By the end, you'll have hands-on exposure to many core programming concepts, be able to write useful Python programs, and have a roadmap for continuing to learn and practice programming in Python.

This tutorial assumes no prior programming experience.

We'll cover:

• Python as a calculator

• Basic data types

• Interactive programs: input and output

• Making choices: booleans and flow control

• Lists and loops

• Functions

We'll also practice writing Python scripts, see demos of cool Python applications, and take a quick tour of popular Python libraries.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be in great shape to continue learning Python through longer-form resources and start working on your own Python projects.
