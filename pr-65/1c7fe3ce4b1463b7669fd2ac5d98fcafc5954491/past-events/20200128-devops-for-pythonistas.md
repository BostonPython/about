<p><br/><br/></p>

<p>Sponsored by Red Hat.<br/><br/>Brian Rossa: DevOps and the opinionated programmer.<br/>I'll cover classic arguments about Python tooling -- packaging, test runners, etc -- and how they impact dev time. Then I'll cover how automation (DevOps) is obviating those old arguments.<br/><br/>Zac Delagrange: DevOps Discipline for Python<br/>Developers will learn about common tools and processes that they may encounter when working on a software project, with a focus on Python. An appreciation will be gained for the devops discipline and what it takes to deliver high quality code to your customers after the code has been written.</p>
