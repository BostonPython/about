A scientific Python presentation tonight, sponsored by Klaviyo (http://klaviyo.com).

Introduction to SciPy Ecosystem, Ben Root

Python has a large and active scientific programming community. There are many tools, and more being developed all the time. Orienting yourself within this new world can be confusing. Ben will explain what is available, and when one would use what. We'll have an extensive Q+A session, so bring your questions!

Pizza will be provided.

After the talk, we'll be headed to Meadhall for drinks, sponsored by Here (http://here.com).
