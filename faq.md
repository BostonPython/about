### Questions about Python

- What's the best way to install python?
- What's the best editor to use for python?
- Should I learn python or {{ other_language }} if I want to work in {{ field }}?

## Pro Tips:

When questions start with _"What is the best...?"_, the response should ask for a clarification of the use case.
- What is most important to you?
- Are you working alone, or with other people?
- What are you using now? 
- Are you doing this for curiosity or for a requirement (money, certification, T-Shirts)
- Do you have time to learn something new?


When questions start with _"How do I...?"_, the response should ask for an example of a failing test. In other words, a concrete example of where they are in the problem.
The best requests for help look something like this:
- I tried `{{ url_to_code }}`
- and I got `<example of desired result>`
- but instead I got `{{ url_to_result }}`
