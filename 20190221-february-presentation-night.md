Presentation Night hosted and sponsored by Rue Gilt Groupe

John Nelson, WiFi Passive Radar
WiFi passive radar uses passive sensing of WiFi signals reflected from objects or persons in the immediate vicinity to learn about the immediate environment. We will describe how we built such a radar using Python-based technology. Python provides many packages to allow sensor based calculations to be put together quickly and efficiently. We used numpy, scipy, and scikit-learn to develop algorithms using supervised learning. The talk will provide a flavor of what can be done using Python in this exciting area of IoT development.

Matt Fowler, Using C/C++ Extensions in Python
Runtime performance of machine learning algorithms in Python can pose certain challenges. In this talk we'll examine a numerical algorithm that has performance issues and see how we can utilize C++ extensions in Python to improve our algorithm's performance.
