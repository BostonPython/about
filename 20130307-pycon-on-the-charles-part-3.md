In preparation for their presentations at PyCon US, Jessica, Stephen, and James will rehearse with us! Thanks to Quantopian and EnerNOC (http://enernoc.com) for sponsoring the evening.

Jessica McKellar: How the Internet Works [Novice]

This talk is an introduction to the Internet's structure and protocols through fun experiments from the Python perspective. We'll use Python libraries like Scapy and Twisted to explore what happens at a networking level as you surf the Web, how coffee shop Internet access works, and more.

Stephen McJohn: Python's Law [Novice]

Open source software is changing intellectual property law. The talk would cover recent cases on what elements of software may be copied without infringing copyright, the scope of software patents, enforceability of licenses, damages for copyright infringement, and how the network of community support for projects such as Python may be more potent in litigation than a patent portfolio.

James Tauber: ApplePy: An Apple ][ emulator in Python [Intermediate]

ApplePy is an Apple ][ emulator written in Python. It combines emulation of the 6502 microprocessor with emulation of the keyboard, display (including graphics mode), speaker, cassette and disk drive. This talk will provide a background to Apple ][ internals then dive into the Python code and the challenges of emulating hardware.
