Three talks, sponsored by OM1. (http://www.om1.com/)

Alex Tespkov: Rapydscript

Rapydscript (http://www.rapydscript.com/) is a marriage of Python and JavaScript, a decluttered JavaScript inspired by Python. RapydScript allows to write your JavaScript app in a language much closer to Python without the overhead that other similar frameworks introduce.

Alex Lancaster & Gordon Webster: Modeling pattern formation: a gateway to Python for biologists
Many life scientists want to add computation to their research, but traditional introductions often aren't written with the biologist's intuition in mind. Modeling cool pattern formations can be a great gateway to Python.

Chris Lieb: PyPy

Is your Python program going too slow? PyPy might solve your problem, as it did at BitSight. Chris will tell us about PyPy: what it is, why one might use it, their recent usage of it, the improvements they saw, and how to get started.

Pizza will be provided.
