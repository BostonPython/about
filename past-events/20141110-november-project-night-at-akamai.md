NOTE: This is at AKAMAI!!

Come work on Python projects, get programming help, help others, and hang out. Sponsored by Akamai (http://akamai.com).

Python project nights are unstructured chances for Python developers to work together, mentor each other, connect socially, teach, learn, or do whatever else it is Python developers want to do together.

Our project nights are great ways to build the Python community, by allowing them to meet and interact in whatever way they find most beneficial.

Food: Pizza is sponsored by Akamai (http://akamai.com).

Things to bring: a wireless-enabled laptop and power cord.
