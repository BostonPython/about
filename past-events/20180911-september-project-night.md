September 11, 2018


   

Pizza sponsored by Twilio (https://www.twilio.com).

Bring a laptop. Bring ideas. Bring questions. Bring enthusiasm. Bring friends. The Boston Python Project Night is a time to find others with compatible interests, and work away. Code, hack, teach, learn, meet, laugh, talk: anything goes at Project Night.

You don't need to have a project, and you don't have to show anything to anyone! This is an opportunity to work together with like-minded people. That's it!

All skill levels are welcome. There will be at least two tables of beginning learners, and helpers for them. Other table-topics in the past have been Django, Data, Web Scraping, Hardware, Puzzle, Science, Art. Maybe you have another idea? Bring it!
