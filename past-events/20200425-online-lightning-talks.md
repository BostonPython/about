<p>Let's do some online lightning talks! Do you have a 5-10 minute topic you'd like to share? Sign up: <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NAWtyb6by2PnoNGGxneI1OZSWLyg6q-I1wsMF_lijQ8/edit" rel="nofollow ugc" target="_blank" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NAWtyb6by2PnoNGGxneI1OZSWLyg6q-I1wsMF_lijQ8/edit">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NAWtyb6by2PnoNGGxneI1OZSWLyg6q-I1wsMF_lijQ8/edit</a><br/><br/>If we don't have enough talks, that's OK, we'll do open-ended Q&amp;A. You can add questions to the spreadsheet also: <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NAWtyb6by2PnoNGGxneI1OZSWLyg6q-I1wsMF_lijQ8/edit" rel="nofollow ugc" target="_blank" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NAWtyb6by2PnoNGGxneI1OZSWLyg6q-I1wsMF_lijQ8/edit">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NAWtyb6by2PnoNGGxneI1OZSWLyg6q-I1wsMF_lijQ8/edit</a><br/><br/>Maybe one of the questions will become someone's lightning talk...<br/><br/>Thanks to edX for sponsoring.</p>
