A night of science, sponsored by Seven Bridge Genomics (http://sbgenomics.com) and Compete (http://compete.com). Two Boston-area PyCon poster presenters will tell us about their scientific work with Python:

Clint Howarth, Millions of Genes with Python and Jython

The Analysis and Annotation Engineering group at the Broad Institute uses cpython and jython as fundamental technologies to help sequence, analyze, and publish hundreds of bacterial and viral genomes every year. Clint will describe how his small team uses Python to accomplish big things.

Tom Aldcroft, Keeping the Chandra satellite cool with Python and Xija

The Chandra X-ray Observatory has been producing significant astronomical discoveries since its launch by NASA in July of 1999. The Chandra operations team uses Python for predictive thermal modeling of the spacecraft to maintain a safe thermal environment. Tom will describe the suite of modeling tools and how they take advantage of powerful packages like NumPy, mpi4py, PyTables, and PyGTK with embedded Matplotlib.

We'll also have time for Lightning Talks: if you have something to share, and want to talk for 5-10 minutes, get in touch with me, especially if it's scientific!

As if that's not enough, we'll raffle off some books. If you have any lightly-used books you want to donate, bring them and we'll add them to the pile.

Pizza tonight is sponsored by Seven Bridges Genomics (http://sbgenomics.com). Afterward, we'll head over to Meadhall, with drinks by Compete (http://compete.com).
