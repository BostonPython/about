Dan Cody will tell us about Project Hexapod

Project Hexapod (http://projecthexapod.com) is building a giant robot, and it's powered by Python! Meet Stompy: An open-source, 18ft wide, 4,000 pound, 6-legged hydraulic robot that you can ride. We’re a team of 3 instructors, 1 TA, and 15 students based out of a makerspace in Somerville, Massachusetts called Artisan’s Asylum (http://artisansasylum.com/). We’ve spent the last four months running a class on how to design giant robots (http://rideablehexapod.eventbrite.com/), and Stompy is the end result.

Note: there is no actual robot yet, but Dan will explain all the awesomeness of the project so far!

And then we'll have time for a bunch of lightning talks. If you have something you want to talk about for 5-10 minutes, drop me a line (ned@nedbatchelder.com).

Pizza will be provided, though we don't have a sponsor yet! We may have to pay for it ourselves...

Afterwards, we'll be at Meadhall with drinks paid for by Hubspot (http://hubspot.com).
