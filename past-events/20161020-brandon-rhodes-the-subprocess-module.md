Brandon Rhodes, The subprocess module

The programmer who wants to make sophisticated use of the "subprocess" module embarks upon the great game. Can arbitrary filenames, whitespace-laden strings, and even binary data make it through intact to the process you are invoking — or will process invocation always be susceptible to awkward edge cases? Learn the full story behind how argument strings are quoted, delimited, and interpreted as they pass from Python into the operating system and then are delivered to either a local process or a remote shell!

Brandon is a renowned Python speaker, keynoting PyCon events around the US and the world. He is the current chair of PyCon US.

Pizza will be provided, sponsored by EverQuote.
