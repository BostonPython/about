Tonight, three talks sponsored by edX (http://edx.org) and Quantopian (http://quantopian.com).

Jonathan Kamens: Coal Mine

Coal Mine is Quantopian's open-source tool for monitoring scheduled tasks. Tasks trigger "canaries" when they execute, and Coal Mine sends alerts via email for late canaries. Jonathan will explain how it works, and also some of its novel implementation techniques that can apply to any project.

Rafael Schloming: parsimonious

Many text-processing tasks are easier with a powerful parser at hand. Parsimonious is a PEG parser. Rafael will show of some of the powerful things it can do. What is a PEG parser? I don't know either! Come find out. :)

Brad Smith: lxml

LXML is the go-to Python library for processing XML and HTML. If you deal with XML in Python, you need it in your toolkit. Brad will give us an overview of using it and XPath expressions to do document mining and mangling.

Food will be provided, sponsored by edX. Doors open at 6:30, talks at 7:00.

Drinks afterwards sponsored by Quantopian.
