<p>Exploring Data with Python - Glenn Lehman<br/><br/>In this presentation, we'll review some mathematical foundations needed to perform detailed data analysis, applied in Python. If you know basic Python, you can join us as we explore data, learn how to use statistical analysis to make predictions, and understand the initial steps of exploring a data set to see what might be lurking there. What makes a data set a valid sample instead of meaningless noise? How can we interpret visualizations to determine the quality of data samples?<br/><br/>Mathematical Topics Covered:<br/><br/>- Population<br/>- Sample<br/>- Categorical and Quatitative Data (Probability Distribution)<br/>- Basic visualizations (Bar Plot, Histograms, Stem and Leaf displays)<br/>- Cross Tabulation - Mean, Median, Mode<br/>- Group Frequency<br/>- Standard Deviation<br/>- Percentiles, Quartiles, Quintiles, Deciles<br/>- Plotting (elementary box plot)<br/>- IQR (interquartile range) - Box Plots (traditional/modified)<br/><br/>Python libraries introduced:<br/><br/>- numpy<br/>- pandas<br/>- matplotlib<br/><br/>Working code will be provided in a Jupyter notebook. This presentation will be recorded.</p>
