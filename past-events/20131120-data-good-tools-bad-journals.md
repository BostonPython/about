Come hear about good tools and bad journals! Thanks to Continuum (http://continuum.io) and Scout (http://goscoutgo.com) for sponsoring the night.

Ian Stokes-Rees: Wakari, Blaze, and Bokeh: scalable, multi-user IPython, NumPy, and Interactive Graphics

We're pretty obsessed with Python-centric data analytics, and figuring out how to do this well led to the creation of Continuum Analytics. This talk will tell you about three pieces of that puzzle we have developed over the past year: Wakari, a web based analytics platform, leveraging IPython and IPython Notebook; Blaze, a next generation NumPy; and Bokeh, providing interactive data visualization. All are available now for free as services or open source projects.

John Bohannon: Finding bogus science journals with Python

The task? Submit hundreds of fake scientific papers to fee-charging open access research journals to reveal how many are breaking their promise to do peer review. (http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/60/suppl/DC1) The result? 60%. The tool that did the job? Python!

Pizza will be provided, thanks to Continuum, and afterwards, drinks at Meadhall thanks to Scout! The talks will be livestreamed and archived at http://youtube.com/bostonpython thanks to CustomMade (http://custommade.com)!
