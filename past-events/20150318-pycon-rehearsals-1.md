The first of four PyCon rehearsal nights, this one sponsored by AppNeta (http://appneta.com).

Geoff Gerrietts — Performance by the Numbers: analyzing the performance of web applications (https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/349/)
Everyone knows poor performance when they see it, and performance concerns affect every application -- web applications more than most. But finding performance problems can be extraordinarily difficult, and requires an analytical approach coupled with good instrumentation. This talk explores approaches to instrumentation and what that instrumentation can tell you.

Mali Akmanalp — Other people's messy data (and how not to hate it!) (https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/469/)
Have you ever viscerally hated a dataset? Do you want to just get data cleaning out of the way? Are you always left wondering how it consumes most of your time? Whether you work in the sciences, work with government data or scrape websites, data cleaning is a necessary evil. We'll share our woes and check out state of the art in day to day data cleaning tools and strategies.

Adam Palay — "Words, words, words": Reading Shakespeare with Python (https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/339/)
This talk will give an introduction to text analysis with Python by asking some questions about Shakespeare and discussing the quantitative methods that will go in to answering them. While we’ll use Shakespeare to illustrate our methodologies, we’ll also discuss how they can be ported over into more 21st century texts, like tweets or New York Times articles.

Note that we are starting at 6:30 rather than 7, to have enough time for three presentations!

Pizza will be provided.
