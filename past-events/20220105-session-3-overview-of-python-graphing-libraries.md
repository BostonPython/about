<p>UPDATED 2022-01-02:<br/>In a bit of a last-minute turn of events, we're not going to do a whole session on Seaborn this time. There will be a shorter-than-usual presentation comparing and contrasting some of the most popular Python graphing libraries, then we'll have a bit of a round table discussion so anyone who wants to can discuss their current interests or projects.<br/><br/>The Seaborn session will be rescheduled, and if you've already RSVP'd, you will receive an email about that shortly. Thanks for your understanding!<br/><br/>As this session will have limited space, please keep your RSVP status up to date. If you find that you won't be able to attend after all, please update your status on Meetup to "Not attending" so that someone on the waitlist will have a chance to join. Thanks!<br/><br/>More info available on the Boston Python slack workspace: <a class="link" href="https://about.bostonpython.com/slack" rel="nofollow ugc" target="_blank" title="https://about.bostonpython.com/slack">https://about.bostonpython.com/slack</a></p>
