You do not have to show anything if you don't want to. This is an open-ended opportunity to work together with like-minded people.<br/><br/>Hosts will be on hand help you find the right room and collaborators.<br/><br/>Bring ideas. Bring questions. Bring enthusiasm. Bring friends. The Boston Python Project &amp; Collaboration Night is a time to find others with compatible interests. Code, hack, teach, learn, meet, laugh, talk: anything goes at Project Night.<br/><br/>All skill levels are welcome. There will be at least two rooms of beginning learners, and helpers for them. Other topics in the past have been Django, Data, Web Scraping, Hardware, Puzzles, Science, Testing, Art. Maybe you have another idea?
