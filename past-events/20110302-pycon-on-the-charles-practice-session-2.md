PyCon 2011 (http://us.pycon.org/2011/) is coming up in March in Atlanta. In this second of two sessions, four Boston-area speakers will practice their presentations. If you can't make it to Atlanta, this is a great way to see some of the PyCon talks, and also help your fellow Bostonians to polish their talks.

We have a jam-packed evening: the talks will start at 6:30! Very early!

Using Python to debug C and C++ code (using gdb) (experienced)
Dave Malcolm

Got a difficult C/C++ program to debug? The power of Python is now available from within the GNU debugger. I'll show how you can use simple fragments of Python to quickly track down fiddly bugs in C/C++ code. We'll also see how to use Python to extend gdb with new commands and new ways of visualizing the internal state of a program. More info... (http://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/sessions/27/)

An outsider's look at co-routines. (novice)
Peter Portante

Let's take an outsider's look at coroutines, the underlying concept used by greenlets. First we'll define what they are conceptually, and show some typical use cases. Then we'll take a look at a sampling of the implementations out there to see what they are actually doing to implement the concept. Finally, we'll show their pluses and minuses, and highlight some features of packages that use them. More info... (http://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/sessions/154/)

Ten Years of Twisted (novice)
Glyph Lefkowitz

The Twisted event-driven networking engine is well-known in the Python community. However, only a few of its features are widely understood. This talk will be a brief conceptual introduction to Twisted, followed by a survey of its features, their status, and how development has been proceeding over the years, with a special focus on the last two years of sponsored development.

Useful Namespaces: Context Mangagers and Decorators (experienced extreme)
Jack Diederich

Python has two useful conventions for "I mean it, but only here" and you can say it with Context Managers and Decorators. Both give you the power to define a push/pop of a resource for a set period inside a namespace, be it a function or a level of indentation. This talk is a list of patterns that are implemented by one or the other (including some clever functions that are both). More info... (http://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/sessions/224/)
