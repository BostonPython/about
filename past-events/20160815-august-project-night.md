An evening of collegial cooperation. WE ARE LOOKING FOR A SPONSOR!

Bring a laptop. Bring ideas. Bring questions. Bring enthusiasm. The Boston Python Project Night is a time to find others with compatible interests, and work away. Code, hack, teach, learn, meet, laugh, talk: it all happens at Project Night.

All skill levels are welcome. There will be at least two tables of beginning learners, and helpers for them. Other table-topics in the past have been Django, Data, Web Scraping, Hardware, Puzzle, Science, Art. Anything goes!

If you would like to showcase your company, consider sponsoring! Get in touch with leaders@bostonpython.com to find out more.
