Come work on Python projects, get programming help, help others, and hang out. Bring your own project or work on one you find there. Other ideas are on the previous Project Night page (http://meetup.bostonpython.com/events/17802791/). Experienced Pythonistas will be on hand to help in any way you need.

Audience: Everyone, all levels are welcome!

When: 6:00-9:00, June 22nd

Where: Microsoft NERD Center, One Memorial Drive.

Food: Microsoft will again generously be providing pizza, but anyway, you're supposed to be coming for the Python and the people, not the pizza! :-)
