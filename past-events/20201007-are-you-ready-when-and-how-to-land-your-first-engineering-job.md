<p><br/><br/></p>

<p>An online panel discussion in Zoom! Mingling starts at 6:30, panel discussion at 7:00.<br/><br/>These days, becoming an engineer doesn't require degrees and formal education. But there are lots of questions: what is it really like to work as an engineer? If you are self-taught, how do you know when you are ready for your first job? How do you get that first job? This panel discussion aims to answer those questions and more. We'll talk about what you're expected to know, what the interview process is like, what it's like to work on a Python team, and anything else you want to know about stepping into a job as a programmer.<br/><br/>If you're an aspiring junior engineer, or if you've been one, or if you've hired one, this discussion is for you. Bring your perspective, and join the conversation.<br/><br/>Panelist bios:<br/><br/>* M. Jackson Wilkinson is CTO of Project Beacon, facilitating COVID-19 testing across Massachusetts.
