<p><br/><br/></p>

<p>At this study group session, Melissa Cruz will tell us about list comprehensions! After her presentation, we'll open things up for a Q&amp;A/discussion period so everyone can get involved. This session is beginner-focused and no experience is required.<br/><br/>This is a beginner-to-intermediate level group that encourages learning by way of teaching. Each presenter chooses a topic that they're unfamiliar with, researches it, and then teaches the group what they've learned. We rotate presenters and topics to keep things fresh, so if you've been looking for the motivation to dive into that one mysterious Python feature that you've seen in the codebase, this might be the group for you!<br/><br/>Hope to see you there!<br/><br/>(Is there a topic you'd like to learn about (and then teach us)?
