PyCon 2012 is coming up in March in Santa Clara. In this first of two sessions, two Boston-area speakers will practice their presentations. If you can't make it to PyCon, this is a great way to see some of the PyCon talks, and also help your fellow Bostonians polish their presentations.

Static analysis of Python extension modules using GCC, Dave Malcolm (Experienced)

Want to analyse C/C++ code using Python? I've written a plugin for GCC that embeds Python inside the compiler, allowing you to write new C/C++ compilation passes in Python. I've used this to build a static analysis tool that understands the CPython extension API, and can automatically detect reference-counting bugs, and other errors.

Through The Ether And Back Again: What Happens To A Packet When You Send It, Glyph Lefkowitz (Experienced)

Many - perhaps even most - Python software involves a network, at least a little bit. You've probably written some yourself. But do you really know what happens - to your kernel, to your ethernet card, to Python - when you call socket.send()? Come to this talk and find out: if you dare.

Lightning talks - Get in touch if you want to do a lightning talk, especially if you're planning one for PyCon!

We will be streaming video on Ustream (http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bostonpython).
