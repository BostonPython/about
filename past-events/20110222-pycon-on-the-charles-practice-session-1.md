PyCon 2011 (http://us.pycon.org/2011/) is coming up in March in Atlanta. In this first of two sessions, three Boston-area speakers will practice their presentations. If you can't make it to Atlanta, this is a great way to see some of the PyCon talks, and also help your fellow Bostonians polish their talks.

The presentations will start at 6:45 to make room for everything.

Python-Aware Python (experienced extreme)
Ned Batchelder

Python provides many features for introspecting, analyzing, parsing, compiling, and otherwise grokking Python code. This talk will cover a number of the techniques for writing Python-Aware Python, and will hopefully inspire you to build the next great Python tool. More info...

What Would You Do with an AST? (experienced)
Matthew Demsarais

The ast module in the Python (>= 2.6) standard library provides a representation of python code in a python data structure. We'll begin with a discussion about what an abstract syntax tree is and why it's useful. We can then talk about what's available in the ast module, how it works, and how you can use it. This will be a practical session built around examples examining and modifying live ASTs. More info... (http://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/sessions/184/)

"Dude, Where's My RAM?" - A deep dive into how Python uses memory (experienced extreme)
Dave Malcolm

This talk will give a deep dive into how CPython uses memory. I'll be demonstrating a new tool I've written that analyses CPython's memory usage, and offer hints and tips on how you can reduce the memory footprint of your Python programs. More info...
