Tom Marsh will present "Designing an API for a mobile platform with AppEngine".

Tom is a recent transplant from the UK where he was an architect on the Guardian Open Platform (http://www.guardian.c... (http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform)), a fascinating open API to newspaper stories at the Guardian.

Tom's built a mobile application on the API, and will explain all the pieces: the inception and the philosophy behind the API itself; the homegrown AppEngine client API that reduces the bandwidth requirements for the mobile platform; and a little bit about the browser application.

If you're interested in programmatic access to data, building AppEngine applications, or how to design for mobile platforms, please join us!

We'll likely also have time for either lightning topics or free-form hacking, so bring your ideas...
