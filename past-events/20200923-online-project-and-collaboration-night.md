Come with a topic, and we will find people for you to collaborate with. There are no pre-determined projects, no presentations. You do not have to show anything if you don't want to. This is an open-ended opportunity to work together with like-minded people.<br/><br/>Hosts will be on-hand help you find the right table and collaborators.<br/><br/>Here's a page about Congregate for attendees: <a class="link" href="https://www.notion.so/Attendees-049ea882a7a746f7842438adcb632323" rel="nofollow ugc" target="_blank" title="https://www.notion.so/Attendees-049ea882a7a746f7842438adcb632323">https://www.notion.so/Attendees-049ea882a7a746f7842438adcb632323</a><br/><br/>If you want to help make the event run smoothly, send me an email (ned@bostonpython.com), or find us in the #organizing channel in Slack (<a class="link" href="https://about.bostonpython.com/slack" rel="nofollow ugc" target="_blank" title="https://about.bostonpython.com/slack">https://about.bostonpython.com/slack</a>).<br/><br/>Bring a laptop.
