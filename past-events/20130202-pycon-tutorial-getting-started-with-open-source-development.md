issue trackers, to report and track bugs the diff and patch utilities, to share your source code changes a revision control system, to collaboratively manage changes to projects IRC, to get and give help while contributing in real time testing and building Python projects We'll put these concepts and tools to practice by collaboratively reporting and fixing bugs in a demo Python project.

We'll end with personalized next steps for getting started with open source projects that match your skills and interests.

PyCon tutorials are half-day in-depth courses presented in the days preceding the bulk of PyCon. Rehearsing with a real audience is a great way to prepare. Come ready to learn, and also to provide feedback!
