Spring is here, and it seems like new shoots of Python activity are popping up everywhere. For April, we have an evening dedicated to education and community. We'll have a few informal speakers telling us about their work introducing Python to new Pythonistas, and a discussion about how to foster a larger Python community in Boston and beyond.

Maria Litvin teaches math and computer science at Philips Academy in Andover, and is the author of a number of textbooks covering C++, Java, and of course, Python.

Asheesh Laroia and Jessica McKellar are the co-conspirators behind the recent Python workshop for women, which was a huge hit. Dubbed Pystar.org, the workshop has spread to to Minneapolis and San Francisco, and will be run again here in Boston soon.

Allen Downey teaches computer science at Olin College of Engineering, and is the author of a range of computer science textbooks, including How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python.

I'm hoping these experts can tell us what they know about hatching new Pythonistas, and we can tell them what we'd like to do to enlarge and enrich the Python community.

Chit-chat starts at 6:30 or so, sit-down at 7.
