<p>Hey all, I hope you are all doing well with social distancing. To try out online presentation nights, I'll do a repeat of a previous PyCon talk of mine: Loop Like a Native (<a class="link" href="https://nedbatchelder.com/text/iter.html" rel="nofollow ugc" target="_blank" title="https://nedbatchelder.com/text/iter.html">https://nedbatchelder.com/text/iter.html</a>)<br/><br/>We'll be able to have questions and discussion during the talk. This talk is aimed at beginners, but gets into some more advanced topics as it goes along.</p>
