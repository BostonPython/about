For our March meeting, we're in a new spot! Rue La La is providing the location, the food, and the drinks! We have two great speakers, RSVP at http://meetu.ps/81SQz .

Frank Wiles: Django Developer's Survival Guide

Frank will take us through a quick tour of the must have tools for the modern Django developer: South, Django Debug Toolbar, Celery, Fabric, Haystack, Tastypie, IPython, and so on. Frank runs Revolution Systems in Lawrence Kansas, and has built large Django projects for clients across the country.

James Tauber: You Used Python for What?!

Taking a break from his usual web development, James will give an overview of some of the more unusual things he's done with Python: from graded readers for Ancient Greek to analyzing piano performances; from emulating an Apple ][ to the beginnings of an operating system written in Python. James is the leader of the Pinax project, and runs Eldarion virtually from Burlington, MA.

Plus, a Boston perspective on last week's PyCon 2012 in Santa Clara.

Drinks and socializing included, in Rue La La's spacious headquarters.

Getting to Rue La La:

WALKING
From South Station (8 - 10 minutes):
Coming out of South Station, turn right onto Summer Street. Follow Summer Street over the bridge toward South Boston. Immediately following the bridge, you will see a building on your right with a sign for “Neighborhood Health Plan” and a convenience store. Take this right, down a stairwell that will take you parallel to the water. Follow this path all along the water. There will be a big parking lot on your left, and once you come to the far corner, take a left (you’ll be headed towards the brick buildings. This will take you to A Street, which runs right in front of the Channel Center. #20 is the building diagonally across the street to your right.

Coming out of the Broadway T stop, turn right onto W. Broadway. Follow W. Broadway to A Street. Make a left on A Street, and walk until you get to 20 Channel Center. The building is on the right-hand side of the street, and the entrance is about halfway down the building (you can enter on either side).
