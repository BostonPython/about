Introductory Data Structures! sponsored by NetProspex (http://www.netprospex.com).

Are you new to Python? Or say you got into Python sort of sideways and suspect that there are multiple ways -- potentially more efficient ways -- to solve your programming challenges. If that sounds familiar, then this is the presentation night for you! Python's "batteries included" philosophy means there are a number of built-in tools at your disposal. These three talks will cover some very handy data types and help you start choosing and using the right tools for your tasks.

Langdon White: Lists, Stacks and Queues

Brett Smith: How to Pick the Right Data Structure

Ned Jackson Lovely: Maps, Sets and Graphs

Food is sponsored by NetProspex (http://www.netprospex.com). Drinks afterwards sponsored by InsightSquared (http://insightsquared.com) at their offices.
