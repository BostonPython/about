(PLEASE NOTE DATE CHANGE. Sorry for the inconvenience. See details below.)

Why did you choose Python?

Developers and their companies are using Python to do all kinds of tasks. From utilities to ERP systems. Why are they choosing Python over Java, C++ and other proven enterprise 3 and 4gls?

At this meeting we'll all get a chance to meet each other, learn why we've made this choice and what we've learned in the process.

To kick off the meeting, I have asked George Lambert of Goldenware Travel to explain why his company has switched to Python and the benefits and challenges they are seeing.

The meeting will be held at my office in Somerville. We currently have 7 RSVP's and 10 "Maybe's". Of course that may change with the date change.
