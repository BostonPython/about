<p>A special guest speaker online for July! Simon Willison is a long-time Python creator. His latest big project is Datasette (<a class="link" href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/" rel="nofollow ugc" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/">https://github.com/simonw/datasette/</a>), a tool for exploring and publishing data.<br/><br/>Lightning talks: have you used Datasette, or done other data hacks? Want to do a lightning talk? Send me an email: ned@nedbatchelder.com<br/><br/>Dogsheep: Personal analytics with SQLite and Datasette<br/><br/>Big internet companies collect a bewildering array of data about us - and thanks to the European GDPR law they all have to provide an export button to let us get it back out again.<br/><br/>Converting these exports into SQLite databases lets us start exploring them with Datasette. I've been building a suite of open source tools, called Dogsheep, to gather my personal data from a variety of different sources and analyze them in one place.<br/><br/>I'll demonstrate my personal Dogsheep and show how it combines data from Twitter, GitHub, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Foursquare, Apple Health and more to provide a searchable archive of my digital lifestyle.</p>
