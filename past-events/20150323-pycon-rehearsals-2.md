The second of four PyCon rehearsal nights, this one sponsored by Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/careers/).

Shauna Gordon-McKeon — Open Source for Newcomers and the People Who Want to Welcome Them (https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/346/)

Open source can be fun and rewarding, but it can also be intimidating. This talk addresses some of the biggest technical and psychological barriers to contributing, from the perspective of both the newcomers who want to overcome them and the maintainers who want to remove them.

Itamar Turner-Trauring — A Beginner's Guide to Test-driven Development (https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/364/)

Software is maintained by humans with limited memory and an unfortunate tendency to make mistakes. Test-driven development (TDD) can help you work around these design flaws by providing a permanent, automated specification for your code. Learn how to implement TDD when bug fixing and implementing new features and how this process will ensure your code is correct both now and in the future.

We'll start at 6:30 to have time for both talks and a good discussion. Pizza will be provided.
