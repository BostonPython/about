April 26, 2016


   

Two PyCon-bound speakers will rehearse their talks, sponsored by MassMutual (https://www.massmutual.com/about-us/careers). David Baumgold: Prototyping new APIs with Flask (https://us.pycon.org/2016/schedule/presentation/1694/)

You need to build a new API, but which tools do you use? Flask is a microframework that makes web development a snap, and an ecosystem of extensions and other tools has grown around it to make it perfect for prototyping APIs. In this talk, we'll see how to get started with Flask, and learn the best parts of its ecosystem for API development. More info... (https://us.pycon.org/2016/schedule/presentation/1694/)

Scott Sanderson & Joe Jevnik: Playing with Python Bytecode (https://us.pycon.org/2016/schedule/presentation/1829/)

Ever wondered what Python is actually doing when it executes your code? Want to learn to hand-craft artisanal Python bytecode? In this talk, we explain CPython's internal code representation, and we demonstrate techniques for modifying code objects for fun and profit. More info... (https://us.pycon.org/2016/schedule/presentation/1829/)

Pizza will be provided.

Because these are rehearsals, we will not be recording. You'll be able to see the recording from the actual presentation given at PyCon.
