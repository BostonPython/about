Fellow Snake Charmers,

This month we explore Mod_Python in a workshop setting.

Mod_python is an Apache module that embeds the Python interpreter within the Apache server. With mod_python you can write web-based applications in Python that will run many times faster than traditional CGI. Application built with Mod_Python have access to advanced features such as: access to Apache internals and the ability to retain database connections and other data between requests.

This Meetup will be a useful hands on working introduction to Mod_Python led by George Lambert, with contributions from each of you.

As usual, drinks and pizza will be served -- thanks for the donations they go to the cost of food and the use of Meetup.

Thanks!

Peter
