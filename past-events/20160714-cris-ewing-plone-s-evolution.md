Cris Ewing is a guest speaker from Seattle, reprising his PyCon 2016 keynote.

Plone is a popular, widely used open source content management system built in Python with nearly 15 years of history. As with many complex software systems, Plone has faced challenges over the years, particularly in terms of how easy it is to customize and extend. In this talk, I will explore a number of these challenges and look at how a combination of common software design patterns and innovative libraries have helped Plone to overcome them. In the end, we’ll see how these same approaches can be used in the broader Python ecosphere to address some of the common pitfalls of object oriented design.

Cris has been involved with Plone (https://plone.com/) since 2006 and has served on the board of directors of the Plone Foundation. He teaches web development in Python for the University of Washington Professional and Continuing Education program (http://www.pce.uw.edu/) and has established the Python program at Code Fellows (https://www.codefellows.org/) in Seattle, WA.
