<p><br/><br/></p>

<p>This is the second official meeting of our data science study group! This session will be led by Mike C., who will share some strategies for cleaning up messy or incomplete data sets. We'll start with his presentation and then break out into smaller groups for discussion.<br/><br/>As this session will have limited space, please keep your RSVP status up to date. If you find that you won't be able to attend after all, please update your status on Meetup to "Not attending" so that someone on the waitlist will have a chance to join. Thanks!<br/><br/>More info available on the Boston Python slack workspace: <a class="link" href="https://about.bostonpython.com/slack" rel="nofollow ugc" target="_blank" title="https://about.bostonpython.com/slack">https://about.bostonpython.com/slack</a></p>
