Please read the full event description below for instructions on how to sign up.

Want to contribute to Python? Join us for a 1-day development sprint on the CPython language implementation and standard library. This event is focused specifically on new contributors to the language! Several committers and experienced contributors will be with us to help with the mechanics of the contribution process as we triage tickets and make progress on bugs.

Our goal is for everyone to have submitted at least one patch by the end of the event!

When: 11am - 5pm on Saturday, April 13th, 2013

Where: MIT, room 4-159

Prerequisite: attendees must have at least 1 previous open source contribution experience

Schedule:

overview of the contribution process, gotchas, pro tips, Q&A on points of confusion pick tickets, start working on them lunch, provided by the Python Software Foundation Sprints Committee! more work on tickets wrap up Because this event has both high demand and prerequisites, instead of using meetup.com's first-come, first-serve model we are going to draw attendees from a lottery of those who meet the prerequisites.
