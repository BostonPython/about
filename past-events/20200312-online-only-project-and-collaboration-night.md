<p>NOTE: this event is now ONLINE-ONLY. We are taking the current health concerns seriously and making this an online-only event.<br/><br/>Instead of our usual tables, we will be meeting in Slack channels: <a class="link" href="https://about.bostonpython.com/slack." rel="nofollow ugc" target="_blank" title="https://about.bostonpython.com/slack.">https://about.bostonpython.com/slack.</a> Join us in Slack, and be online Thursday night with us. We will have people to help you find the right channel and collaborators.<br/><br/>If you have ideas about how to make an online project night better, come talk to us in the #organizing channel in Slack.<br/><br/>Bring a laptop. Bring ideas. Bring questions. Bring enthusiasm. Bring friends. The Boston Python Project &amp; Collaboration Night is a time to find others with compatible interests. Code, hack, teach, learn, meet, laugh, talk: anything goes at Project Night.<br/><br/>You don't need to have a project, and you don't have to show anything to anyone! This is an opportunity to work together with like-minded people. There's no presentation, there are no pre-set projects, just people working on whatever they want to work on. That's it!<br/><br/>All skill levels are welcome. There will be at least two tables of beginning learners, and helpers for them. Other table topics in the past have been Django, Data, Web Scraping, Hardware, Puzzles, Science, Art. Maybe you have another idea? Bring it!<br/><br/>Here are some Python resources to get you started: <a class="link" href="https://about.bostonpython.com/resources" rel="nofollow ugc" target="_blank" title="https://about.bostonpython.com/resources">https://about.bostonpython.com/resources</a><br/><br/>Feel free to discuss ideas beforehand on our Slack: <a class="link" href="https://about.bostonpython.com/slack" rel="nofollow ugc" target="_blank" title="https://about.bostonpython.com/slack">https://about.bostonpython.com/slack</a><br/><br/>We'll all be online starting at 6:30!</p>
