Patrick Moran will tell us about building desktop applications with Python, sponsored by http://embed.ly and Jana (http://jana.com). Tell your friends: http://meetu.ps/g70Tz

Have you ever wanted to distribute your Python script to a user that didn't have Python installed? It's not easy for non-Pythonists. Maybe you should consider making it into an installable "MSI" file. This talk will show how to build a stand-alone installable Windows MSI installer using a collection of open source tools such as PyQT, py2exe and Inno Setup. I will walk you through the installation, configuration and compilation steps needed to build a demonstration application. Bring your own code and play along too!

We will have time for lightning talks, send an email to ned@nedbatchelder.com if you want 5-10 minutes to talk about any Python-related topic you like! Something you wrote? Something you found? Something you like? Something you hate? Now's your chance!

Pizza will be provided by http://embed.ly , afterwards, we'll be at Meadhall, with drinks sponsored by Jana (http://jana.com).
