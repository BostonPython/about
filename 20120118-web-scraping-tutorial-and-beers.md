For our presentation this month, Asheesh Laroia will preview his PyCon tutorial!

Web scraping: Reliably and efficiently pulling data from pages that don't expect it

Exciting information is trapped in web pages and behind HTML forms. In this lecture, you'll learn the basics of how to parse those pages and when to apply advanced techniques that make scraping faster and more stable. We'll cover parallel downloading with Twisted, gevent, and others; analyzing sites behind SSL; driving JavaScript-y sites with Selenium; and evading common anti-scraping techniques.

This month's Boston Python talk is a preview of a tutorial that Asheesh Laroia will deliver at PyCon ( https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/317/ ). The format is 1h30min of fast-paced lecture, and 30 minutes for Q&A and feedback. (At PyCon, tutorials are a full three hours, so this will be somewhat abbreviated.)

Pizza will be provided by Nokia.

Afterwards we'll head over to Meadhall for drinks.
