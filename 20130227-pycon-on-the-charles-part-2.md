In preparation for their presentations at PyCon US, Ned, David, and James will rehearse with us! Thanks to Arista Networks and ZEFR (http://zefr.com) for sponsoring the evening.

Ned Batchelder: Loop like a native [Novice]

Python provides powerful primitives for iterating over your data in ways that let you express yourself clearly and directly. But even programmers familiar with the tools don't use them as fully as they could. This talk will cover Python's iteration tools, from basic loops to generators and how to add iteration to your own classes. Come learn how looping was meant to be!

David Malcolm: Death by a thousand leaks: what statically-analysing 370 Python extensions looks like [Experienced]

What happens when you run a custom C static analysis tool ("cpychecker") on hundreds of Python extensions? I'll talk about the kinds of errors that my tool found, how to run it on your own code, and how to prevent memory leaks and crasher bugs in the C code of your Python extension modules.

James Tauber: Music Theory and Performance Analysis with Sebastian and Czerny [Novice]

This talk will discuss two open source projects for using Python for music analysis. Sebastian focuses on music theory while Czerny focuses on performance (particularly keyboard playing).
