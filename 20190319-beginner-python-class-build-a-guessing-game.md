Coding Temple is giving an Introduction to Python class tonight. This class is aimed at absolute beginners. Regular attendees: please don't take a space if you don't need to learn these skills, thanks!

In this workshop, you will learn about the basics of Python programming. Connor Milliken teaches Python and Data Science at Coding Temple in Boston. He designed this class for beginners who have little to no experience in programming but are interested in getting started with Python in a short span of one free evening class.

In order to accommodate complete beginners, we will start at Hello World, then learn what data types, variables, inputs, lists, and loops are and how to create them. Then you will take everything you learned in this class and build a simple guessing game at the end.

Seating will be theatre-style, so make sure you bring a laptop that you are comfortable with using on your lap.

You must have the following installed in order to begin coding at this event. Please install before the evening begins:

• Python 3.5.x (or higher) https://www.python.org/downloads/ (Python 2.7.x will not be sufficient)

• PyCharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)

We'll gather at 6:30 for pizza and mingling, and then get started in earnest at 7:00. We look forward to seeing you there!
