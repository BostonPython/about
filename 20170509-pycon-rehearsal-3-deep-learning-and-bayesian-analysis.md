Rehearsals for two PyCon speakers, sponsored and hosted by Amazon.

A gentle introduction to deep learning with TensorFlow
Michelle Fullwood

Deep learning's explosion of spectacular results over the past few years may make it appear esoteric and daunting, but in reality, if you are familiar with traditional machine learning, you're more than ready to start exploring deep learning. This talk aims to gently bridge the divide by demonstrating how deep learning operates on core machine learning concepts and getting attendees started coding deep neural networks using Google's TensorFlow library.

Bayesian Statistical Analysis with Python

Eric J. Ma

You've got some data, and now you want to analyze it with Python. You're on your way to greatness! Now the problem comes: do I do the t-test? Chi-squared test? How do I decide? In this talk, I will show you how you can take common statistical decision problems, formulate them as a Bayesian analysis problem, and use PyMC3 as your workhorse tool for gaining insights. This talk will be math-light and code-heavy, and if you download the slides, you'll have a simple template for more complex Bayesian analysis down the road!
