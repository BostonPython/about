title: Lightning Talks
---

Lightning talks are 5-10 minutes long, on any topic of interest to other Python people.  It doesn't have to be about something that you wrote, it can be something that you learned, or a technique you think other people will be interested in.

* You know that thing at work that everyone comes to you for help with? **Talk about that!**

* You know that thing you just learned that helped you out? **Talk about that!**

* You know that thing you always wish you understood, but haven't figured out yet? Learn it, then **talk about that!**

Things people say when they think they can't do a lightning talk:

* *"Everyone already knows THING_X"*
    - No, they don't.
    - They think they do, but they still have more to learn.
    - Even if they do, they will be interested to hear another person's explanation.

* *"I'm not an expert at anything"*
    - You know more than you think you do.
    - You don't have to be an expert, you just have to be interested enough to talk for 5 minutes.
    - People like hearing from peers. Beginners can do a talk.

* *"My topic has been done before"*
    - Everything has already been done, you will do it your way.
    - New people haven't heard it before.
    - When Google started, people wondered why we needed another search engine.

* *"It's scary talking in front of people"*
    - Yes, but you will feel really accomplished when you've done it.
    - Boston Python is super-friendly and is always welcoming of new speakers.
    - Everyone is nervous speaking in public, even people you think wouldn't be nervous.

* *"I have an idea but it's no good"*
    - It's a better idea than you think.
    - Send me the idea, we'll tweak it up.
    - Are there really any bad ideas for lightning talks? :)

**Seriously**: anyone can do a lightning talk.

If you need more encouragement, watch this lightning talk about brewing tea (hint: it's not really about brewing tea):
