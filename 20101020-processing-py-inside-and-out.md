For our October meetup, Jonathan Feinberg will talk about his work on Processing.py. Processing is "an open source programming language and environment for people who want to create images, animations, and interactions." (http://processing.org... (http://processing.org/)) It's implemented in Java, and offers a simplified Java-like syntax for students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists. Jonathan's Processing.py brings makes it possible to write Processing sketches in Python.

Jonathan's presentation will start by introducing Processing, demoing what it can do, and how it has helped artists and designers experiment with algorithmic art and visualizations.

Then he'll get into the deep details of how he used Jython to meld a Python interpreter into the Processing implementation to allow Python programs access to the Processing execution environment.

It should be a very interesting evening, looking at both the user-visible environment, and the nitty-gritty under the hood of how it was accomplished.

The talk starts at 7:00, social niceties both before and after.

LOCATION: We'll be meeting at the Google offices this month, at 5 Cambridge Center. Google will be providing pizza, but unfortunately, there is NO subsidized parking. Parking in the adjacent garage is $17 for 3 hours. If you know of other appropriate alternatives, send them to the list.
