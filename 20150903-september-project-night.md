September 03, 2015


   

Come work on Python projects, get programming help, help others, and hang out. Sponsored by Pixability (http://pixability.com).

Python project nights are unstructured chances for Python developers to work together, mentor each other, connect socially, teach, learn, or do whatever else it is Python developers want to do together.

Our project nights are great ways to build the Python community, by allowing them to meet and interact in whatever way they find most beneficial.

Food: Pizza will be provided.

Things to bring: a wireless-enabled laptop and power cord.

Need some project ideas? How about:

Learning Python
