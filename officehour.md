Boston Python holds a weekly Zoom office hour on Mondays at noon.

This is an unstructured time to drop in to ask questions or just chat. There is no set topic, anything goes: Python, Boston Python, specialized technical topics, adjacent technologies, it's all good.  Any expertise level is fine!

The office hour happens on Zoom. The [event page on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/bostonpython/events) has the link.  Questions and topics can be added in the [#office-hour][office-hour-channel] channel in our [Slack workspace][slack]. See you there!
