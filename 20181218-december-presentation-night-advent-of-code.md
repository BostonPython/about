Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like: http://adventofcode.com. This is its fourth year. Give it a try, the puzzles have a fun Santa theme, and are clever challenges.

Ned Batchelder will walk through a particular day's puzzle (12/14/2016) with an eye toward explaining the Python features that you can use for your own projects. If you have a puzzle that you especially liked, get in touch!

We'll also have some giveaways. Join us for a relaxed end-of-year gathering!
