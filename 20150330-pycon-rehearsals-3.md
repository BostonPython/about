Our third night of PyCon rehearsals, sponsored by MassMutual.

Michelle Fullwood — Grids, Streets and Pipelines: Building a linguistic street map with scikit-learn (https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/366/)

Have you built a classifier in scikit-learn with out-of-the-box features, been disappointed with the results, and wanted to know where to go next? This talk shows how to add your own feature Pipelines and how to tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV. We'll apply this to the problem of classifying streetnames in Singapore by linguistic origin, and turn the results into a colour-coded street map.

Sarina Canelake — I18N: World Domination the Easy Way (https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/403/)

Have you heard about internationalization (i18n) and wondered what it meant? Perhaps your project already has i18n of its strings but you have a nagging feeling you could be doing it better. This talk will walk through the basics of i18n’ing a Django project (but the principles apply to any project!), and how to make the process of localization (l10n) go more smoothly.

Ned Batchelder — Facts and Myths about Python names and values (https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/362/)

The behavior of names and values in Python can be confusing. Like many parts of Python, it has an underlying simplicity that can be hard to discern, especially if you are used to other programming languages. Here I'll explain how it all works, and present some facts and myths along the way. Call-by-reference? Call-by-value? The answer will be clear!
