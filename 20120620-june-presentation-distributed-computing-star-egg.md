Two talks about lashing machines together to do big work! Sponsored by CloudLock and Rue La La. Tell your friends: http://meetu.ps/cXWmR

StarCluster, Justin Riley

StarCluster is a cluster computing toolkit for the cloud, developed in Python by The Software Tools for Academics and Researchers (STAR) group at MIT. StarCluster makes it easy to create and manage parallel and distributed computing clusters on Amazon's EC2. Additionally, a command line interface provides utilities for working with clusters, machines, and data volumes. StarCluster also exposes a Python plugin API that allows users to customize their systems beyond the defaults. StarCluster also includes public machine images, equipped with frameworks out-of-the-box including OpenMPI, OpenMP, Hadoop, (Py)CUDA, (Py)OpenCL, and IPython (parallel).

In this talk I will give an overview of StarCluster and how to get started using it with these various parallel frameworks on real clusters in the cloud. I will also cover using StarCluster's Python plugin API to further configure a cluster and automate various workflows.

Integrating Distributed Systems with Egg, Saul Youssef

Egg is a python framework that lets you integrate distributed systems into a coherent whole. I'll talk about the rationale for egg and show how we're using it to manage a large (2.2PB, 3500 core) joint B.U./Harvard computer center. Egg is kind of perfect for "big data" applications if you're interested in that. I keep thinking that this has something to do with the security of the open internet too, but my friends think I'm crazy. We'll see...

We may have time for a few lightning talks, get in touch if you want to give one!

Pizza will be provided by CloudLock (http://cloudlock.com), and drinks afterwards at Meadhall by Rue La La (http://ruelala.com)!
