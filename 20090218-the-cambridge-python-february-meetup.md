Topic: "A Whirlwind Excursion through Python C Extensions"

If you've never explored the Python C API, now's your chance to journey there safely. In 45 minutes, Ned Batchelder will cover the tools and techniques of writing C code to execute inside the Python interpreter. The terrain may be challenging, but we guarantee you will return unscathed.

This is a preview of a Pycon 2009 presentation.

Afterwards we will invite folks to give lightning talks (5 min or less presentations) on topics that are interested in sharing with the group.

We can go to a local watering hole after the meetup for further discussion and socializing.
