title: Giving a Presentation

Boston Python's presentation events are a place for members of our community
to share what they've learned about making Python programs. Giving a
presentation to our audience is a way to give back to the community, and it
helps you understand the subject matter better - it's a win all around!

Presenters do not need to be "experts", they do not need to have contributed to
the python language, created a library, or written a book. Anyone who has worked
with the language and learned something interesting from doing so has something
to share, and our community wants to hear you share it.

### How do I know if I have something to say?
If you're not sure whether you've got a Boston Python presentation in you, take
this quiz:

- Have you learned something about the python language?
- Has it been useful to you?
- Do you think someone else might find it useful?

If you answered "yes" to any of those questions, there's a presentation waiting
to happen - and we'll help you find it, if you want.

### What sorts of talks are you interested in?
We're open to topics of interest to a community of python users and learners,
ranging from quick "lightning talks" to deep-dive talks. Ideally, talks should
be pitched to an audience including users of all levels, from beginner to
experienced professional.

### But really, what should I talk about?
If you think a topic would be interesting to you, that's a good start! To
inspire you, we have a long list of [past talks](https://about.bostonpython.com/past-events/)
If you're still not sure, reach out to an organizer and we'll help you find a topic.

### Okay, I'm interested. Where do I start?
If you're interested in presenting to the Boston Python community, and you have
a topic in mind, you can start by filling out

If you have questions about giving a presentation, you can always reach out to
an organizer on the Boston Python [slack channel](slack.md) (Jon, Ned, and
James are good bets to start with).
