In response to a member-suggested idea, we've got two Testing advocates for May:

Marshall Weir: Testing, Where Do I Start?

Marshall will cover basic unit test concepts and quickly move to making your tests motivating, easy to run and adding testing to an existing project. He's aiming squarely at developers who have projects they want to use testing for, but don't know where to get started.

Have you wanted to become test-infected but couldn't find the start of the thread to pull? Marshall will help.

Stephan Richter: How to Test the Hard Stuff

Stephan will cover testing network-driven components, RDB stubbing, test setup layering and stuff like that. Recently he used manuel to do this sort of testing by simulating CLIs and Shell access in a doctest-style test, so he may cover that as well.

Bring your testing challenges and the impossible to automate projects that haunt you at night, we'll see what Stephan can do with them.

We're meeting as usual at the Microsoft NERD Center, 1 Memorial Drive in Cambridge. People will be there starting at 6:30, talks begin at 7. There will likely be pizza donated by Microsoft.
