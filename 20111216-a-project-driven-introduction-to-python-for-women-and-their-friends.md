Learn and practice Python basics with this project-driven workshop!

Audience: Women and their friends who have no or limited programming experience. This event is welcoming and respectful of trans women. Men are welcome as guests of women who are attending (please RSVP as well).

On Friday evening you'll set up your development environment and start learning Python through a self-directed tutorial and online practice problems.

On Saturday we'll spend the morning on a lecture-based introduction to the language, taking breaks to practice concepts on bite-sized exercises. In the afternoon we'll break out into groups to practice Python through short projects on a variety of fun and practical topics.

Check out photos and feedback (http://meetup.bostonpython.com/events/33124602/) from our previous workshop.

You must be able to attend both days of the workshop to participate.

Our goal is to provide an environment in which women can develop their programming skills with confidence. Our staff are predominantly women from the Boston programming and open source communities.
