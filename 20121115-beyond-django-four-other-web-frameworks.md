November 15, 2012


   

Note: I know this event conflicts with a Django Boston event, we are so sorry! We're working to make sure this doesn't happen again...

Django is the most popular Python web framework, but there are lots of other choices. Tonight, four members will present overviews of some other options:

David Baumgold: Flask Jason Michalski: Pyramid David Sturgis: twisted.web and Klein Ricardo Newbery: Zope and Plone We'll follow up with a free-ranging Q&A session about web frameworks in general, or whatever else comes to mind!

Pizza is sponsored by Nuance (http://nuance.com).

At Nuance, we’re the people who make voice work. We design and deliver intuitive technologies that help people live and work more intelligently. We provide the tools to inform, to connect, and to empower people to be more productive and creative. We give people more than just control over their communications. We give them command of their lives.
