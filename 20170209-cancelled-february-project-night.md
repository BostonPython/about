February 09, 2017


   

Expecting 10 inches of snow, we'll find another time to do this! :)

An evening of friendly face-time, sponsored by Pluralsight. (http://pluralsight.com/)

Bring a laptop. Bring ideas. Bring questions. Bring enthusiasm. Bring friends. The Boston Python Project Night is a time to find others with compatible interests, and work away. Code, hack, teach, learn, meet, laugh, talk: it all happens at Project Night.

All skill levels are welcome. There will be at least two tables of beginning learners, and helpers for them. Other table-topics in the past have been Django, Data, Web Scraping, Hardware, Puzzle, Science, Art. Anything goes!

Pizza will be provided! You can't be friendly, helpful, and productive if you're hungry...
