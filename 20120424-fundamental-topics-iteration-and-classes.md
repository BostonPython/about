April 24, 2012


   

The April presentation night will have two tutorials on fundamental Python topics. These are aimed at beginners, to bring them up to speed on two important Python topics, but intermediate users will pick up details and gain a deeper understanding. Of course, all are welcome!

Iteration, Ned Batchelder

An important tool in any programming language is looping over a sequence of values. Python provides unusually rich support for iteration. Learning Python's iteration tools will give you a deeper understanding of the language, and let you use the language like a native.

Classes, Anna Callahan & David Baumgold

You can get a long way in Python without using classes, but classes are a powerful tool for organizing your programs. This topic will cover how to architect a complete program using object-oriented techniques.

Pizza will be sponsored by Oracle, thanks!
