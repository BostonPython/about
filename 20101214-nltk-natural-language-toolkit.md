NLTK is the Natural Language Toolkit, an extensive Python library for processing natural language. Shankar Ambady will give us a tour of just a few of its extensive capabilities, including sentence parsing, synonym finding, spam detection, and more. Linguistic expertise is not required, though if you know the difference between a hyponym and a hypernym, you might be able to help the rest of us!

Socializing at 6:30, Shankar's presentation at 7:00. See you at the NERD.
