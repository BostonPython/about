The Boston Python group is focused on building a community in the Boston area
among Python people. We're of course interested to hear about relevant jobs,
but don't want the list to become another source of distracting spam. To that
end, there are four requirements for job postings to the mailing list:

- The job must significantly involve Python, for example, more than half of the
  work is in Python.
- The job must be available to someone living in the Boston area. Either it's
  in Boston, or remote is OK.
- The name of the hiring firm must be clearly provided. No mystery firms hidden
  behind a hiring agency.
- The subject line must include "[Job]" to help people filter messages. For
  example, your subject line could look like this:
  ```
  [Job] Junior engineer at Initech
  ```

It's also a good idea, but not required, to include an email address in the
message, so that people can contact you directly.

If your job posting meets these simple rules, feel free to send it to the
mailing list at [python-181@meetup.com][email]. The message make take a few
hours to go out, it has to be moderated.

If your message doesn't go through, there are some things to check:

- You must be a member of the Boston Python group.
- Be sure to send your message from the email address you used when signing up
  for Meetup.com.
- Some people have reported that you have to visit your Meetup settings and
  elect to receive updates from the mailing list.

Please don't use attachments, most readers won't open them anyway. Don't
re-send announcements to the list too often: you will wear out readers'
attention; six months is a good interval.

If you have questions about the format of job postings, take a look at the
[previous messages to the list][message-archive].

By the way, if you find this mailing list useful, it'd be great to make a
[donation to the group][donate].

Please don't post jobs as event comments, or create wiki pages, etc. Thanks.
