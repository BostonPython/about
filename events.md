Boston Python runs two events most months:

- **Presentation nights** feature presentations by members.  These are technical peer-to-peer presentations.  Anyone can do one!  Sometimes we do [lightning talks](lightning.md).
- **Project nights** are unstructured times to sit with people with similar interests, and do whatever you would like to do.

Specific events are listed on the [Boston Python meetup page](http://bostonpython.com).  RSVP there to be assured a spot.
