Boston Python runs four kinds of events:

- **Presentation nights** feature presentations by members.  These are technical peer-to-peer presentations.  Anyone can do one!  Sometimes we do [lightning talks](lightning.md).
- **Collaboration nights** are unstructured times to sit with people with similar interests, and do whatever you would like to do.
- **Python Study Group nights** feature presentations by members who are beginner-to-intermediate. Each presenter chooses a topic that they're unfamiliar with, researches it, and then teaches the group what they've learned.
- [**Office hour**](officehour.md] is a weekly hour to drop in and ask anything on your mind.

Specific events are listed on the [Boston Python meetup page](http://bostonpython.com).  RSVP there to be sure to get a spot.
