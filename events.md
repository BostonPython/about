Boston Python runs several kinds of events, most of which are listed on the [Boston Python meetup page](http://bostonpython.com). RSVP there to be sure to get a spot.

- [**Office hour**](officehour.md) is a weekly hour to drop in and ask anything on your mind.
- **Presentation nights** feature presentations by members.  These are technical peer-to-peer presentations.  Anyone can do one!  Sometimes we do [lightning talks](lightning.md).
- **Python Study Group nights** feature presentations by members who are beginner-to-intermediate. Each presenter chooses a topic that they're unfamiliar with, researches it, and then teaches the group what they've learned.
- **Book Discussion nights** host discussion focused on particular books. As of March 2023, this group is currently discussing **Fluent Python (2nd ed.)** on Monday evenings. (Note: this group does **not** post events on Meetup, join us on Slack to participate!)
- **Python en Español** discusión en español sobre Python.
- **Collaboration nights** are unstructured times to sit with people with similar interests, and do whatever you would like to do.

We have a [long list of past events](past-events/index.md).
