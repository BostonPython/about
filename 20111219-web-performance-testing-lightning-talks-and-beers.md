Corey Goldberg of Canonical and Dan Kuebrich of Tracelytics will tag-team to tell us about web performance testing, and a few interesting tools they've built.

Brief Introduction to Web Performance and Scalabilty Testing

When launching a new application, preparing for future capacity, or changing IT infrastructure, web performance and scalability testing allows you to find and fix performance problems. You simulate the current or projected user workload against your site, allowing you to test and tune your systems, and allocate hardware accordingly.

Web Load Testing with Python and Multi-Mechanize

Multi-Mechanize is a Python framework for API performance and scalabilty testing. It enables you to run simultaneous Python scripts to generate load (synthetic transactions) against any API or service. This is useful for system tuning, benchmarking, and capacity planning. Multi-Mechanize is Free Open Source Software.

Demo of Tracelytics with Multi-Mechanize

Building on Corey's presentation of multi-mechanize, Dan Kuebrich will discuss how to make the most of load testing your Python-based web app and talk about how Tracelytics' Python instrumentation is implemented.

Pizza will be provided by Canonical (http://www.canonical.com/).

We'll probably have some time for lightning talks. If you have something to say for 10 minutes, especially if it's related to web measurement, let me know.

Afterwards we'll head over to Meadhall for drinks, the first round will be sponsored by Kyruus (http://kyruus.com).
