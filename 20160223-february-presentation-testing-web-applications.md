Two talks about specialized tools for testing web applications, sponsored by Klaviyo (https://www.klaviyo.com/) and Twilio (http://twilio.com).

Michael Mintz, SeleniumBase: Reliable browser testing

Web applications have to be tested in real browsers to know they are working properly. The most common tool for this is Selenium, but anyone who has used it knows that it can be cumbersome and unpredictable. Michael will explain some of Selenium's pitfalls, and show us the layer he's written on top, SeleniumBase, which solves many of its problems.

Jay Luker, Pytest plugins and Ghost Inspector

Pulling all the pieces of a web test together can be difficult, using disparate tools and services to cover all your bases. Jay has written a pytest plugin to connect pytest to a browser testing service, Ghost Inspector. He'll walk through the whats, hows & whys of pytest plugins, and how his plugin lets you hook Ghost Inspector's test execution into the pytest framework.

Pizza will be provided, by Klaviyo. Drinks afterwards at Meadhall, sponsored by Twilio.
