Two talks tonight, with plenty of time for mingling, meeting, and greeting. If you would like to sponsor, get in touch!

Chelsea Voss and Anders Kaseorg: One-lining Python

A common past-time among programmers is finding how much they can accomplish in one line of code. Chelsea has made all that work unnecessary with oneliner: it automatically converts any Python program into a single line of code. What!? Why!? How!? Chelsea and Anders will explain all.

David Baumgold: Flask-Dance

Flask is a popular lightweight Python web framework. OAuth is a popular authentication mechanism that allows you to use web sites without sharing your password. Implementing OAuth can get complicated. David will show us his Flask-Dance library that lets you implement OAuth on your Flask site easily, letting your users log in with Facebook/Google/GitHub/etc.

Drinks afterwards at Meadhall, sponsored by Twilio.
