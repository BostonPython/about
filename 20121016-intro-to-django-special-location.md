Have you been wanting to learn how to use Django, the foremost web framework for Python? This is your chance!

Kevin Grinberg will give an introduction to Django for those who have never used it. The first hour will be Kevin's presentation. The second hour you can use as you like: some of us will be holding an open-ended ask-anything Q&A, and others will be doing hands-on work on their own computers, with help from roving experts.

What to bring: your Python language skills (beginners welcome!), and a fully-charged laptop if you want to do hands-on work.

And of course there will be time for chatting and socializing, thanks to food and drink provided by Rue La La. They are also hosting us in their offices at 20 Channel Center in Boston in the Innovation District. Thanks, Rue La La!

Where we'll be: We're meeting at Rue La La's offices at 20 Channel Center. There is (paid) parking in the complex, or at meters on the street. The building is a 10-minute walk from the Red Line. More details:

WALKING

From South Station (8 - 10 minutes):

Coming out of South Station, turn right onto Summer Street. Follow Summer Street over the bridge toward South Boston. Immediately following the bridge, you will see a building on your right with a sign for “Neighborhood Health Plan” and a convenience store. Take this right, down a stairwell that will take you parallel to the water. Follow this path all along the water. There will be a big parking lot on your left, and once you come to the far corner, take a left (you’ll be headed towards the brick buildings. This will take you to A Street, which runs right in front of the Channel Center. #20 is the building diagonally across the street to your right.

From Broadway T Stop (8 - 10 minutes):

Coming out of the Broadway T stop, turn right onto W. Broadway. Follow W. Broadway to A Street. Make a left on A Street, and walk until you get to 20 Channel Center. The building is on the right-hand side of the street, and the entrance is about halfway down the building (you can enter on either side).

Parking:

There are three lots to choose from. One small lot is directly across from Barlow’s on Binford Street. This is primarily used by employees with monthly passes. Across the street from the entrance is a large lot ($12), which accepts cash or check when you exit. Next to that lot on the right is a parking garage, which is $12/day ($10 if you’re in before 9 and out before 6). They only accept credit cards, and you’ll pay on your way out.
