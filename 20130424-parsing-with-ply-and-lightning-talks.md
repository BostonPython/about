We have a short presentation about PLY, and then LIGHTNING TALKS. Thanks to CustomMade (http://custommade.com) for sponsoring pizza, and Carbonite for sponsoring drinks afterwards!

Parsing with PLY, Johnny Healey

This talk will provide an introduction to PLY, a python-based implementation of lex and yacc. There will be a brief summary of what lexer and parser generators are and when they are appropriate to use. The talk will then proceed into a tutorial of how PLY can be used to construct a parser. Demonstration examples will revolve around the creation of a simple engine for processing the bbcode markup language.

LIGHTNING TALKS

We have a variety of lightning talks planned, including:

Making snowflakes with Python Check.io Descriptors Blood Analysis Economic simulation with open government data Python anti-patterns And more... I don't know how many we'll be able to squeeze in, but it should be a great night! We'll be doing more lightning talks at future events, so if your talk doesn't fit, don't worry, there will be more opportunities.
