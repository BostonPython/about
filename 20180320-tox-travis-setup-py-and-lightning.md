Sponsored by FormLabs.

One long talk, and some lightning.

Jason Held: Tox, Travis, setup.py, etc

You've written your awesome Python code. How to package it up, make it available to people, and know that it's working well? Beyond just writing the code, there are support services like continuous integration (Travis), test environments (Tox), installation (setup.py), and so on. Jason will walk us through the details of these important but often put-off details.

Two lightning talks:

Becca Perry: Seam Carving
Jonathan Biddle: What Gets Measured Gets Done
