Boston Python has a Slack workspace. Please join us!

You can invite yourself at https://slack.bostonpython.com.

Once in, there are a number of channels, depending on what you are looking for:

- #general is the default channel. When in doubt, ask here.
- #organizing is for talking about how the group works, and making it work better.
