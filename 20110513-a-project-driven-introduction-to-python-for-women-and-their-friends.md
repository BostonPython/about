Learn and practice Python basics with this project-driven workshop!

Audience: Women and their friends who have no or limited programming experience. This event is welcoming and respectful of trans women. Men are welcome as guests of women who are attending.

On Friday evening you'll set up your development environment, learn how to execute Python code from a file and interactively from a Python prompt, and practice printing and using Python as a calculator.

On Saturday we'll spend the morning on a lecture-based introduction to the language, taking breaks to practice concepts on bite-sized exercises. In the afternoon we'll break out into groups to practice Python through short projects on a variety of fun and practical topics.

Projects include:

using the Twitter API to write parts of a Twitter client a Jeopardy!-themed introduction to databases and database access with Python graphing and data analysis text-based games wordplay and the power of regular expressions programming graphical effects for a ColorWall See the Workshop wiki (http://openhatch.org/wiki/Boston_Python_workshop_2) for more information on laptop setup, lecture material, and the projects, as well as workshop logistics including parking and childcare.

Our goal is to provide a comfortable environment in which women can develop their programming skills with confidence. Our staff are predominantly women from the Boston programming and open source communities.
