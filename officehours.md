Boston Python holds a weekly Zoom office hour on Mondays at noon, sponsored by [edX](https://edx.org).

This is an unstructured time to drop in to ask questions or just chat. There is no set topic, anything goes: Python, Boston Python, specialized technical topics, adjacent technologies, it's all good.  Any expertise level is fine! For now, this is an experiment. We may change the structure, pace, or timing as we see what happens.

The office hour happens on Zoom. The [event page on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/bostonpython/events) has the link.  You do not have to sign up ahead of time, **just drop in**.  See you there!
