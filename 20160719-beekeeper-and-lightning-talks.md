Jesse Shapiro, Better REST Clients with Beekeeper

REST APIs are everywhere these days. As simple as their model is, there is still a frustrating amount of variation among them. Beekeeper is a new library for consuming REST APIs that simplifies the boring parts so you can focus on what your application is supposed to be doing.

Lightning talks:

Stephanie Davis, virtualenv
Sarah Dawson, requests
Elena Glassman, pythontutor
Samantha Scharr, argparse
Joanna Lowry-Duda, NaN breaks sorting
